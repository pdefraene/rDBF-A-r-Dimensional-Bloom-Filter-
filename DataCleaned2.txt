chapter
i
the
onondaga
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
advanced
with
utmost
caution
through
a
forest
so
thick
with
undergrowth
that
it
hid
all
objects
twenty
yards
away
he
was
not
armed
with
a
rifle
but
carried
instead
a
heavy
bow
while
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
hung
over
his
shoulder
he
wore
less
clothing
than
when
he
was
in
the
white
mans
school
at
albany
his
arms
and
shoulders
being
bare
though
not
painted
the
young
indians
aspect
too
had
changed
the
great
struggle
between
english
and
french
drawing
with
it
the
whole
north
american
wilderness
had
begun
and
although
the
fifty
sachems
still
sought
to
hold
the
six
nations
neutral
many
of
their
bravest
warriors
were
already
serving
with
the
americans
and
english
ranging
the
forest
as
scouts
and
guides
and
skirmishers
bringing
to
the
campaign
an
unrivaled
skill
and
a
faith
sealed
by
the
long
alliance
tayoga
had
thrown
himself
into
the
war
heart
and
soul
nothing
could
diminish
by
a
hair
his
hostility
to
the
french
and
the
tribes
allied
with
them
the
deeds
of
champlain
and
frontenac
were
but
of
yesterday
and
the
nation
to
which
they
belonged
could
never
be
a
friend
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
trusted
the
americans
and
the
english
but
his
chief
devotion
by
the
decree
of
nature
was
for
his
own
people
and
now
that
fighting
in
the
forest
had
occurred
between
the
rival
nations
he
shed
more
of
the
white
ways
and
became
a
true
son
of
the
wilderness
seeing
as
red
men
saw
and
thinking
as
red
men
thought
he
was
bent
over
a
little
as
he
walked
slowly
among
the
bushes
in
the
position
of
one
poised
for
instant
flight
or
pursuit
as
the
need
might
be
his
eyes
black
and
piercing
ranged
about
incessantly
nothing
escaping
a
vision
so
keen
and
trained
so
thoroughly
that
he
not
only
heard
everything
passing
in
the
wilderness
but
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
sound
and
what
had
made
it
the
kindly
look
that
distinguished
tayoga
in
repose
had
disappeared
unnumbered
generations
were
speaking
in
him
now
and
the
indian
often
so
gentle
in
peace
had
become
his
usual
self
stern
and
unrelenting
in
war
his
strong
sharp
chin
was
thrust
forward
his
cheek
bones
seemed
to
be
a
little
higher
his
tread
was
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
bent
before
his
moccasins
and
no
leaves
rustled
he
was
in
every
respect
the
wilderness
hunter
and
warrior
fitted
perfectly
by
the
supreme
hand
into
his
setting
and
if
an
enemy
appeared
now
he
would
fight
as
his
people
had
fought
for
centuries
and
the
customs
and
feelings
of
the
new
races
that
had
come
across
the
ocean
would
be
nothing
to
him
a
hundred
yards
more
and
he
sat
down
by
the
trunk
of
a
great
oak
convinced
that
no
foe
was
near
his
own
five
splendid
senses
had
told
him
so
and
the
fact
had
been
confirmed
by
an
unrivaled
sentinel
hidden
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
a
small
bird
that
poured
forth
a
wonderful
volume
of
song
were
any
other
coming
the
bird
would
cease
his
melody
and
fly
away
but
tayoga
felt
that
this
tiny
feathered
being
was
his
ally
and
would
not
leave
because
of
him
the
song
had
wonderful
power
too
soothing
his
senses
and
casting
a
pleasing
spell
his
imaginative
mind
infused
with
the
religion
and
beliefs
of
his
ancestors
filled
the
forest
with
friendly
spirits
unseen
they
hovered
in
the
air
and
watched
over
him
and
the
trees
alive
bent
protecting
boughs
toward
him
he
saw
too
the
very
spot
in
the
heavens
where
the
great
shining
star
on
which
tododaho
lived
came
out
at
night
and
glittered
he
remembered
the
time
when
he
had
gone
forth
in
the
dusk
to
meet
tandakora
and
his
friends
and
how
tododaho
had
looked
down
on
him
with
approval
he
had
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
the
great
leagues
founder
and
the
spirit
that
dwelt
on
the
shining
star
still
watched
over
him
the
ojibway
whom
he
hated
and
who
hated
him
in
yet
greater
measure
might
be
somewhere
in
the
forest
but
if
he
came
near
the
feathered
sentinel
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
would
give
warning
tayoga
sat
nearly
half
an
hour
listening
to
the
song
of
the
bird
he
had
no
object
in
remaining
there
his
errand
bade
him
move
on
but
there
was
no
hurry
and
he
was
content
merely
to
breathe
and
to
feel
the
glory
and
splendor
of
the
forest
about
him
he
knew
now
that
the
indian
nature
had
never
been
taken
out
of
him
by
the
schools
he
loved
the
wilderness
the
trees
the
lakes
the
streams
and
all
their
magnificent
disorder
and
war
itself
did
not
greatly
trouble
him
since
the
legends
of
the
tribes
made
it
the
natural
state
of
man
he
knew
well
that
he
was
in
tododahos
keeping
and
if
by
chance
the
great
chief
should
turn
against
him
it
would
be
for
some
grave
fault
and
he
would
deserve
his
punishment
he
sat
in
that
absolute
stillness
of
which
the
indian
by
nature
and
training
was
capable
the
green
of
his
tanned
and
beautifully
soft
deerskin
blending
so
perfectly
with
the
emerald
hue
of
the
foliage
that
the
bird
above
his
head
at
last
took
him
for
a
part
of
the
forest
itself
and
so
having
no
fear
came
down
within
a
foot
of
his
head
and
sang
with
more
ecstasy
than
ever
it
was
a
little
gray
bird
but
tayoga
knew
that
often
the
smaller
a
bird
was
and
the
more
sober
its
plumage
the
finer
was
its
song
he
understood
those
musical
notes
too
they
expressed
sheer
delight
the
joy
of
life
just
as
he
felt
it
then
himself
and
the
kinship
between
the
two
was
strong
the
bird
at
last
flew
away
and
the
onondaga
heard
its
song
dying
among
the
distant
leaves
a
portion
of
the
forest
spell
departed
with
it
and
tayoga
returning
to
thoughts
of
his
task
rose
and
walked
on
instinct
rather
than
will
causing
him
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
earth
and
foliage
when
he
saw
the
faint
trace
of
a
large
moccasin
on
the
earth
all
that
was
left
of
the
spell
departed
suddenly
and
he
became
at
once
the
wilderness
warrior
active
alert
ready
to
read
every
sign
he
studied
the
imprint
which
turned
in
and
hence
had
been
made
by
an
indian
its
great
size
too
indicated
to
him
that
it
might
be
that
of
tandakora
a
belief
becoming
with
him
almost
a
certainty
as
he
found
other
and
similar
traces
farther
on
he
followed
them
about
a
mile
reaching
stony
ground
where
they
vanished
altogether
and
then
he
turned
to
the
west
the
fact
that
tandakora
was
so
near
and
might
approach
again
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
as
tayoga
having
all
the
soul
of
a
warrior
was
anxious
to
match
himself
with
the
gigantic
ojibway
and
since
the
war
was
now
active
on
the
border
it
seemed
that
the
opportunity
might
come
but
his
attention
must
be
occupied
with
something
else
for
the
present
and
he
went
toward
the
west
for
a
full
hour
through
the
primeval
forest
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
listen
even
lying
down
and
putting
his
ear
to
the
ground
but
the
sounds
he
heard
although
varied
and
many
were
natural
to
the
wild
he
knew
them
all
the
steady
tapping
was
a
woodpecker
at
work
upon
an
old
tree
the
faint
musical
note
was
another
little
gray
bird
singing
the
delight
of
his
soul
as
he
perched
himself
upon
a
twig
the
light
shuffling
noise
was
the
tread
of
a
bear
hunting
succulent
nuts
a
cawcaw
so
distant
that
it
was
like
an
echo
was
the
voice
of
a
circling
crow
and
the
tiny
trickling
noise
that
only
the
keenest
ear
could
have
heard
was
made
by
a
brook
a
yard
wide
taking
a
terrific
plunge
over
a
precipice
six
inches
high
the
rustling
one
great
blended
note
universal
but
soft
was
that
of
the
leaves
moving
in
harmony
before
the
gentle
wind
the
young
onondaga
was
sure
that
the
forest
held
no
alien
presence
the
traces
of
tandakora
were
hours
old
and
he
must
now
be
many
miles
away
with
his
band
and
such
being
the
case
it
was
fit
time
for
him
to
choose
a
camp
and
call
his
friends
it
pleased
tayoga
zealous
of
mind
to
do
all
the
work
before
the
others
came
and
treading
so
lightly
and
delicately
that
he
would
not
have
alarmed
a
rabbit
in
the
bush
he
gathered
together
dead
sticks
and
heaped
them
in
a
little
sunken
place
clear
of
undergrowth
flint
and
steel
soon
lighted
a
fire
and
then
he
sent
forth
his
call
the
long
penetrating
whine
of
the
wolf
the
reply
came
from
the
north
and
building
his
fire
a
little
higher
he
awaited
the
result
without
anxiety
the
dry
wood
crackled
and
many
little
flames
red
or
yellow
arose
tayoga
heaped
dead
leaves
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
sat
down
comfortably
his
shoulders
and
back
resting
against
the
bark
presently
he
heard
the
first
alien
sound
in
the
forest
a
light
tread
approaching
that
he
knew
was
willet
and
then
he
heard
the
second
tread
even
lighter
than
the
first
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
footstep
of
robert
all
ready
its
like
you
tayoga
said
willet
as
he
entered
the
open
space
here
you
are
with
the
house
built
and
the
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
i
lighted
the
fire
said
tayoga
rising
but
manitou
made
the
hearth
and
built
the
house
which
is
worthy
of
him
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
magnificent
trees
spreading
away
on
every
side
and
the
foliage
in
its
most
splendid
new
luxuriant
green
it
is
worthy
tayoga
said
robert
whose
soul
was
like
that
of
the
onondaga
and
it
takes
manitou
himself
a
century
or
more
to
grow
trees
like
these
some
of
them
i
dare
say
are
three
or
four
hundred
years
old
or
more
said
willet
and
the
forest
goes
west
so
ive
heard
the
indians
say
a
matter
of
near
two
thousand
miles
its
pleasant
to
know
that
if
all
the
axes
in
the
world
were
at
work
it
couldnt
all
be
cut
down
in
our
time
or
in
the
time
of
our
children
tayogas
heart
swelled
with
indignation
at
the
idea
that
the
forest
might
be
destroyed
but
he
said
nothing
as
he
knew
that
willet
and
robert
shared
his
feeling
heres
your
rifle
tayoga
said
the
hunter
i
suppose
you
didnt
have
an
occasion
to
use
your
bow
and
arrows
no
great
bear
replied
the
onondaga
but
i
might
have
had
the
chance
had
i
come
earlier
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
saw
on
the
grass
a
human
trace
it
was
made
by
a
foot
clothed
in
a
moccasin
a
large
foot
a
very
large
foot
the
foot
of
a
man
whom
we
all
have
cause
to
hate
i
take
it
youre
speaking
of
tandakora
the
ojibway
none
other
i
cannot
be
mistaken
but
the
trail
was
cold
he
and
his
warriors
have
gone
north
they
may
be
thirty
forty
miles
from
here
likely
enough
tayoga
theyre
on
their
way
to
join
the
force
the
french
are
sending
to
the
fort
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
and
the
alleghany
perhaps
st
lucand
there
isnt
a
cleverer
officer
in
this
continentis
with
them
i
tell
you
tayoga
and
you
too
robert
i
dont
like
it
that
young
washington
ought
to
have
been
sent
earlier
into
the
ohio
country
and
they
should
have
given
him
a
much
larger
force
were
sluggards
and
all
our
governors
are
sluggards
except
maybe
shirley
of
massachusetts
with
the
war
just
blazing
up
the
french
are
already
in
possession
and
were
to
drive
em
out
which
doubles
our
task
it
was
a
great
victory
for
us
to
keep
the
hodenosaunee
on
our
side
or
in
the
main
neutral
but
its
going
to
be
uphill
work
for
us
to
win
the
young
french
leaders
are
genuine
kings
of
the
wilderness
you
know
that
robert
as
well
as
i
do
yes
said
the
youth
i
know
theyre
the
men
whom
the
english
colonies
have
good
cause
to
fear
when
he
spoke
he
was
thinking
of
st
luc
as
he
had
last
seen
him
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
defeated
in
the
appeal
to
the
fifty
sachems
but
gallant
well
bred
showing
nothing
of
chagrin
and
sure
to
be
a
formidable
foe
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
an
enemy
of
whom
one
could
be
proud
and
robert
felt
an
actual
wish
to
see
him
again
even
though
in
opposing
ranks
we
may
come
into
contact
with
some
of
em
said
the
hunter
the
french
are
using
all
their
influence
over
the
indians
and
are
directing
their
movements
i
know
that
st
luc
jumonville
beaujeu
dumas
de
villiers
de
courcelles
and
all
their
best
men
are
in
the
forest
its
likely
that
tandakora
fierce
and
wild
as
he
is
is
acting
under
the
direction
of
some
frenchman
st
luc
could
control
him
robert
thought
it
highly
probable
that
the
chevalier
was
in
truth
with
the
indians
on
the
border
either
leading
some
daring
band
or
gathering
the
warriors
to
the
banner
of
france
his
influence
with
them
would
be
great
as
he
understood
their
ways
adapted
himself
to
them
and
showed
in
battle
a
skill
and
daring
that
always
make
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
savage
heart
the
youth
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
in
the
test
of
words
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
now
he
felt
that
he
must
match
himself
anew
but
in
the
test
of
forest
war
tayoga
having
lighted
the
fire
the
hunter
cooked
the
food
over
it
while
the
two
youths
reposed
calmly
robert
watched
willet
with
interest
and
he
was
impressed
for
the
thousandth
time
by
his
great
strength
and
the
lightness
of
his
movements
when
he
was
younger
the
disparity
in
years
had
made
him
think
of
willet
as
an
old
man
but
he
saw
now
that
he
was
only
in
early
middle
age
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
on
his
head
and
his
face
was
free
from
wrinkles
an
extraordinarily
vivid
memory
of
that
night
in
quebec
when
the
hunter
had
faced
boucher
the
bully
and
bravo
reputed
the
best
swordsman
of
france
leaped
up
in
roberts
mind
he
had
found
no
time
to
think
of
willets
past
recently
and
he
realized
now
that
he
knew
little
about
it
the
origin
of
that
hunter
was
as
obscure
as
his
own
but
the
story
of
the
past
and
its
mysteries
must
wait
the
present
was
so
great
and
overwhelming
that
it
blotted
out
everything
else
the
venison
and
the
bacon
are
ready
said
willet
and
you
two
lads
can
fall
on
youre
not
what
id
call
epicures
but
ive
never
known
your
appetites
to
fail
nor
will
they
said
robert
as
he
and
tayoga
helped
themselves
whats
the
news
from
britain
dave
you
must
have
heard
a
lot
when
you
were
in
albany
its
vague
robert
vague
the
english
are
slow
just
as
we
americans
are
too
theyre
going
to
send
out
troops
but
the
french
have
dispatched
a
fleet
and
regiments
already
the
fact
that
our
colonies
are
so
much
larger
than
theirs
is
perhaps
an
advantage
to
them
as
it
gives
them
a
bigger
target
to
aim
at
and
our
people
who
are
trying
to
till
their
farms
will
be
struck
down
by
their
indians
from
ambush
and
you
see
now
what
a
bulwark
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
is
to
the
english
said
tayoga
a
fact
that
ive
always
foreseen
said
willet
warmly
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
the
power
of
the
six
nations
and
nobody
has
ever
been
readier
to
admit
it
i
know
great
bear
you
have
always
been
our
true
friend
if
all
the
white
men
were
like
you
no
trouble
would
ever
arise
between
them
and
the
hodenosaunee
robert
finished
his
food
and
resumed
a
comfortable
place
against
a
tree
willet
put
out
the
fire
and
he
and
tayoga
sat
down
in
like
fashion
their
trees
were
close
together
but
they
did
not
talk
now
each
was
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
robert
had
much
to
think
about
the
war
was
going
slowly
he
had
believed
a
great
flare
would
come
at
once
and
that
everybody
would
soon
be
in
the
thick
of
action
but
since
young
washington
had
been
defeated
by
coulon
de
villiers
at
the
great
meadows
the
british
colonies
had
spent
much
time
debating
and
pulling
in
different
directions
the
union
for
which
his
eager
soul
craved
did
not
come
and
the
shadow
of
the
french
power
in
the
north
reinforced
by
innumerable
savages
hung
heavy
and
black
over
the
land
every
runner
brought
news
of
french
activities
rumor
painted
as
impregnable
the
fort
they
had
built
where
two
rivers
uniting
formed
the
ohio
and
it
was
certain
that
many
bands
already
ranged
down
in
the
regions
the
english
called
their
own
spring
had
lingered
far
into
summer
where
they
were
and
the
foliage
was
not
yet
touched
by
heat
all
the
forest
was
in
deep
and
heavy
green
hiding
every
object
a
hundred
yards
away
but
from
their
opening
they
saw
a
blue
and
speckless
sky
which
the
three
by
and
by
watched
attentively
and
with
the
same
motive
before
the
dark
had
begun
to
come
in
the
east
they
saw
a
thin
dark
line
drawn
slowly
across
it
the
trail
of
smoke
it
might
not
have
been
noticed
by
eyes
less
keen
but
they
understood
at
once
that
it
was
a
signal
robert
noted
its
drifting
progress
across
the
heavens
and
then
he
said
to
willet
how
far
from
here
do
you
calculate
the
base
of
that
smoke
is
dave
a
long
distance
robert
several
miles
maybe
the
fire
ive
no
doubt
was
kindled
on
top
of
a
hill
it
may
be
french
speaking
to
indians
or
indians
talking
to
indians
and
you
dont
think
its
people
of
ours
im
sure
it
isnt
weve
no
hunters
or
runners
in
these
parts
except
ourselves
and
its
not
tandakora
said
the
onondaga
he
must
be
much
farther
away
but
the
signal
may
be
intended
for
him
said
the
hunter
it
may
be
carried
to
him
by
relays
of
smoke
i
wish
i
could
read
that
trail
across
the
sky
its
thinning
out
fast
said
robert
you
can
hardly
see
it
and
now
its
gone
entirely
but
the
hunter
continued
to
look
thoughtfully
at
the
sky
where
the
smoke
had
been
he
never
underrated
the
activity
of
the
french
and
he
believed
that
a
movement
of
importance
something
the
nature
of
which
they
should
discover
was
at
hand
lads
he
said
i
expected
an
easy
night
of
good
sleep
for
all
three
of
us
but
im
thinking
instead
that
wed
better
take
to
the
trail
and
travel
toward
the
place
where
that
smoke
was
started
its
what
scouts
would
do
said
tayoga
tersely
and
such
we
claim
to
be
said
robert
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
they
saw
far
in
the
west
another
smoke
that
would
have
been
invisible
had
it
not
been
outlined
against
a
fiery
red
sky
across
which
it
lay
like
a
dark
thread
it
was
gone
in
a
few
moments
and
then
the
dusk
began
to
come
an
answer
to
the
first
signal
said
tayoga
it
is
very
likely
that
a
strong
force
is
gathering
perhaps
tandakora
has
come
back
and
is
planning
a
blow
it
cant
be
possible
that
theyre
aiming
it
at
us
said
the
hunter
thoughtfully
they
dont
know
of
our
presence
here
and
if
they
did
weve
too
small
a
party
for
such
big
preparations
perhaps
a
troop
of
pennsylvanians
are
marching
westward
said
tayoga
and
the
french
and
their
allies
are
laying
a
trap
for
them
then
said
robert
there
is
but
one
thing
for
us
to
do
we
must
warn
our
friends
and
save
them
from
the
snare
of
course
said
willet
but
we
dont
know
where
they
are
and
meanwhile
wed
better
wait
an
hour
or
two
perhaps
something
will
happen
that
will
help
us
to
locate
them
robert
and
tayoga
nodded
and
the
three
remained
silent
while
the
night
came
the
blazing
red
in
the
west
faded
rapidly
and
darkness
swept
down
over
the
wilderness
the
three
each
leaning
against
his
tree
did
not
move
but
kept
their
rifles
across
their
knees
ready
at
once
for
possible
use
tayoga
had
fastened
his
bow
over
his
back
by
the
side
of
his
quiver
and
their
packs
were
adjusted
also
robert
was
anxious
not
so
much
for
himself
as
for
the
unknown
others
who
were
marching
through
the
wilderness
and
for
whom
the
french
and
indians
were
laying
an
ambush
it
had
been
put
forward
first
as
a
suggestion
but
it
quickly
became
a
conviction
with
him
and
he
felt
that
his
comrades
and
he
must
act
as
if
it
were
a
certainty
but
no
sound
that
would
tell
them
which
way
to
go
came
out
of
this
black
forest
and
they
remained
silent
waiting
for
the
word
the
night
thickened
and
they
were
still
uncertain
what
to
do
robert
made
a
silent
prayer
to
the
god
of
the
white
man
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
for
a
sign
but
none
came
and
infected
strongly
as
he
was
with
the
indian
philosophy
and
religion
he
felt
that
it
must
be
due
to
some
lack
of
virtue
in
himself
he
searched
his
memory
but
he
could
not
discover
in
what
particular
he
had
erred
and
he
was
forced
to
continue
his
anxious
waiting
until
the
stars
should
choose
to
fight
for
him
tayoga
too
was
troubled
his
mind
in
its
own
way
being
as
active
as
roberts
he
knew
all
the
spirits
of
earth
air
and
water
were
abroad
but
he
hoped
at
least
one
of
them
would
look
upon
him
with
favor
and
give
him
a
warning
he
sought
tododahos
star
in
the
heavens
but
the
clouds
were
too
thick
and
eye
failing
he
relied
upon
his
ear
for
the
signal
which
he
and
his
young
white
comrade
sought
so
earnestly
if
tayoga
had
erred
either
in
omission
or
commission
then
the
spirits
that
hovered
about
him
forgave
him
as
when
the
night
was
thickest
they
gave
the
sign
it
was
but
the
faint
fall
of
a
foot
and
at
first
he
thought
a
bear
or
a
deer
had
made
it
but
at
the
fourth
or
fifth
fall
he
knew
that
it
was
a
human
footstep
and
he
whispered
to
his
comrades
some
one
comes
as
if
by
preconcerted
signal
the
three
arose
and
crept
silently
into
the
dense
underbrush
where
they
crouched
their
rifles
thrust
forward
it
is
but
one
man
and
he
walks
directly
toward
us
whispered
tayoga
i
hear
him
now
said
robert
he
is
wearing
moccasins
as
his
step
is
too
light
for
boots
which
means
that
hes
a
rover
like
ourselves
said
willet
now
hes
stopped
there
isnt
a
sound
the
man
whoever
he
is
has
taken
alarm
or
at
least
hes
decided
that
its
best
for
him
to
be
more
watchful
perhaps
hes
caught
a
whiff
from
the
ashes
of
our
fire
hes
white
or
he
wouldnt
be
here
alone
and
hes
used
to
the
forest
or
he
wouldnt
have
suspected
a
presence
from
so
little
the
great
bear
thinks
clearly
said
tayoga
it
is
surely
a
white
man
and
some
great
scout
or
hunter
he
moved
a
little
now
to
the
right
because
i
heard
his
buckskin
brush
lightly
against
a
bush
i
think
great
bear
is
right
about
the
fire
the
wind
has
brought
the
ashes
from
it
to
his
nostrils
and
he
will
lie
in
the
bush
long
before
moving
which
doesnt
suit
our
plans
at
all
said
willet
theres
a
chance
just
a
chance
that
i
may
know
who
he
is
white
men
of
the
kind
to
go
scouting
through
the
wilderness
are
not
so
plenty
on
the
border
that
one
has
to
make
many
guesses
you
lads
move
away
a
little
so
you
wont
be
in
line
if
a
shot
comes
and
ill
give
a
signal
robert
and
tayoga
crept
to
other
points
in
the
brush
and
the
hunter
uttered
a
whistle
low
but
very
clear
and
musical
in
a
moment
or
two
a
like
answer
came
from
a
place
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
willet
rising
advanced
without
hesitation
robert
and
tayoga
followed
promptly
and
a
tall
figure
emerging
from
the
darkness
came
forward
to
meet
them
the
stranger
was
a
man
of
middle
years
and
of
a
singularly
wild
appearance
his
eyes
roved
continually
and
were
full
of
suspicion
and
of
a
sort
of
smoldering
anger
as
if
he
had
a
grievance
against
all
the
world
his
hair
was
long
and
tangled
his
face
brown
with
sun
and
storm
and
his
dress
more
indian
than
white
he
was
heavily
armed
and
whether
seen
in
the
dusk
or
in
the
light
his
whole
aspect
was
formidable
and
dangerous
but
willet
continued
to
advance
without
hesitation
captain
jack
he
said
extending
his
hand
we
were
not
looking
for
you
tonight
but
no
man
could
be
more
welcome
these
are
young
friends
of
mine
brave
warriors
both
the
white
and
the
red
robert
lennox
who
is
almost
a
son
to
me
and
tayoga
the
onondaga
to
whom
i
feel
nearly
like
a
father
too
now
robert
knew
him
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
of
the
most
intense
curiosity
who
along
the
whole
border
had
not
heard
of
captain
jack
known
also
as
the
black
hunter
the
black
rifle
and
by
many
other
names
the
tale
had
been
told
in
every
cabin
in
the
woods
how
returning
home
he
had
found
his
wife
and
children
tomahawked
and
scalped
and
how
he
had
taken
a
vow
of
lifelong
vengeance
upon
the
indians
a
vow
most
terribly
kept
in
all
the
villages
in
the
ohio
country
and
along
the
great
lakes
the
name
of
black
rifle
was
spoken
with
awe
and
terror
no
more
singular
and
ominous
figure
ever
crossed
the
pages
of
border
story
he
swept
the
two
youths
with
questing
glances
but
they
met
his
gaze
firmly
and
while
his
eye
had
clouded
at
first
sight
of
the
onondaga
the
threatening
look
soon
passed
friends
of
yours
are
friends
of
mine
dave
willet
he
said
i
know
you
to
be
a
good
man
and
true
and
once
when
i
was
at
albany
i
heard
of
robert
lennox
and
of
the
great
young
warrior
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
young
onondagas
eyes
flashed
with
pleasure
but
he
was
silent
how
does
it
happen
willet
asked
black
rifle
that
we
meet
here
in
the
forest
at
such
a
time
were
on
our
way
to
the
ohio
country
to
learn
something
about
the
gathering
of
the
french
and
indian
forces
just
before
sundown
we
saw
smoke
signals
and
we
think
our
enemies
are
planning
to
cut
off
a
force
of
ours
somewhere
here
in
the
forest
black
rifle
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
laugh
it
had
in
it
a
quality
that
made
robert
shudder
your
guesses
are
good
dave
said
black
rifle
about
fifty
men
of
the
pennsylvania
militia
are
in
camp
on
the
banks
of
a
little
creek
two
miles
from
here
they
have
been
sent
out
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
think
of
that
dave
theyre
to
be
a
guard
against
the
french
and
indians
his
face
contracted
into
a
wry
smile
and
robert
understood
his
feeling
of
derision
for
the
militia
as
i
told
you
theyre
in
camp
continued
black
rifle
they
built
a
fire
there
to
cook
their
supper
and
to
show
the
french
and
indians
where
they
are
lest
they
miss
em
in
the
darkness
they
dont
know
what
part
of
the
country
theyre
in
but
theyre
sure
its
a
long
distance
west
of
philadelphia
and
if
the
indians
will
only
tell
em
when
theyre
coming
theyll
be
ready
for
em
oh
theyre
brave
enough
theyll
probably
all
die
with
their
faces
to
the
enemy
he
spoke
with
grim
irony
and
robert
shuddered
he
knew
how
helpless
men
from
the
older
parts
of
the
country
were
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
and
he
was
sure
that
the
net
was
already
being
drawn
about
the
pennsylvanians
are
the
french
here
too
black
rifle
asked
willet
the
strange
man
pointed
toward
the
north
a
band
led
by
a
frenchman
is
there
he
replied
he
is
the
most
skillful
of
all
their
men
in
the
forest
the
one
whom
they
call
st
luc
i
thought
so
exclaimed
robert
i
believed
all
the
while
he
would
be
here
ive
no
doubt
he
will
direct
the
ambush
we
must
warn
this
troop
said
willet
and
save
em
if
they
will
let
us
you
agree
with
me
dont
you
tayoga
the
great
bear
is
right
and
youll
back
me
up
of
course
robert
will
you
help
us
too
black
rifle
the
singular
man
smiled
again
but
his
smile
was
not
like
that
of
anybody
else
it
was
sinister
and
full
of
menace
it
was
the
smile
of
a
man
who
rejoiced
in
sanguinary
work
and
it
made
robert
think
again
of
his
extraordinary
history
around
which
the
border
had
built
so
much
of
truth
and
legend
i
will
help
of
course
he
replied
its
my
trade
it
was
my
purpose
to
warn
em
before
i
met
you
but
i
feared
they
would
not
listen
to
me
now
the
words
of
four
may
sound
more
real
to
em
than
the
words
of
one
then
lead
the
way
said
willet
tis
not
a
time
to
linger
black
rifle
without
another
word
threw
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
started
toward
the
north
the
others
falling
into
indian
file
behind
him
a
light
pleased
smile
played
over
his
massive
and
rugged
features
more
than
the
rest
he
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
combat
they
did
not
seek
battle
and
they
fought
only
when
they
were
compelled
to
do
so
but
he
with
his
whole
nature
embittered
forever
by
that
massacre
of
long
ago
loved
it
for
its
own
sake
he
had
ranged
the
border
a
torch
of
fire
for
years
and
now
he
foresaw
more
of
the
revenge
that
he
craved
incessantly
he
led
without
hesitation
straight
toward
the
north
all
four
were
accomplished
trailers
and
the
flitting
figures
were
soundless
as
they
made
their
swift
march
through
the
forest
in
a
half
hour
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
rather
high
hill
and
black
rifle
stopping
pointed
with
a
long
forefinger
toward
a
low
and
dim
light
the
camp
of
the
pennsylvanians
he
said
with
bitter
irony
as
i
told
you
fearing
lest
the
savages
should
miss
em
in
the
forest
they
keep
their
fire
burning
as
a
beacon
dont
be
too
hard
on
em
black
rifle
said
willet
maybe
they
come
from
philadelphia
itself
and
city
bred
men
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
learn
all
about
the
wilderness
in
a
few
days
theyll
learn
when
its
too
late
at
the
muzzles
of
the
french
and
indian
rifles
rejoined
black
rifle
abating
a
little
his
tone
of
savage
derision
at
least
theyre
likely
to
be
brave
men
said
willet
and
now
what
do
you
think
will
be
our
best
manner
of
approaching
em
well
walk
directly
toward
their
fire
the
four
of
us
abreast
theyll
blaze
away
all
fifty
of
em
together
as
soon
as
they
see
us
but
the
darkness
will
spoil
their
aim
and
at
least
one
of
us
will
be
left
alive
able
to
walk
and
able
to
tell
em
of
their
danger
we
dont
know
wholl
be
the
lucky
man
but
well
see
come
come
captain
jack
give
em
a
chance
they
may
be
a
more
likely
lot
than
you
think
you
three
wait
here
and
ill
go
forward
and
announce
our
coming
i
dare
say
well
be
welcome
willet
advanced
boldly
toward
the
fire
which
he
soon
saw
consisted
of
a
great
bed
of
coals
surrounded
by
sleepers
but
the
figures
of
men
pacing
back
and
forth
showed
that
the
watch
had
not
been
neglected
although
in
the
deep
forest
such
sentinels
would
be
but
little
protection
against
the
kind
of
ambush
the
french
and
indians
were
able
to
lay
not
caring
to
come
within
the
circle
of
light
lest
he
be
fired
upon
the
hunter
whistled
and
when
he
saw
that
the
sentinels
were
at
attention
he
whistled
again
then
he
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
walked
boldly
toward
the
fire
who
are
you
a
voice
demanded
sharply
and
a
young
man
in
a
fine
uniform
stood
up
in
front
of
the
fire
the
hunters
quick
and
penetrating
look
noted
that
he
was
tall
built
well
and
that
his
face
was
frank
and
open
my
name
is
david
willet
he
replied
and
i
am
sometimes
called
by
my
friends
the
iroquois
the
great
bear
behind
me
in
the
woods
are
three
comrades
young
robert
lennox
of
new
york
and
albany
tayoga
a
young
warrior
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
the
famous
hunter
and
border
fighter
of
whom
everybody
has
heard
captain
jack
black
hunter
or
black
rifle
as
he
has
been
called
variously
i
know
the
name
replied
the
young
man
and
yours
too
mr
willet
my
own
is
colden
james
colden
of
philadelphia
and
i
am
in
command
of
this
troop
sent
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
against
the
french
and
indians
will
you
call
your
comrades
mr
willet
all
of
you
are
welcome
the
hunter
whistled
again
and
robert
tayoga
and
black
rifle
advancing
from
the
forest
came
within
the
area
of
half
light
cast
by
the
glow
from
the
coals
young
captain
colden
watching
them
with
the
most
intense
curiosity
as
they
approached
and
well
he
might
feel
surprise
all
even
robert
wore
the
dress
of
the
wilderness
and
their
appearance
at
such
a
time
was
uncommon
and
striking
most
of
the
soldiers
had
been
awakened
by
the
voices
and
were
sitting
up
rubbing
sleepy
eyes
robert
saw
at
once
that
they
were
city
men
singularly
out
of
place
in
the
vast
forest
and
the
darkness
we
welcome
you
to
our
camp
said
young
captain
colden
with
dignity
if
you
are
hungry
we
have
food
and
if
you
are
without
blankets
we
can
furnish
them
to
you
willet
and
tayoga
looked
at
robert
and
he
knew
they
expected
him
to
fill
his
usual
role
of
spokesman
the
words
rushed
to
his
lips
but
they
were
held
there
by
embarrassment
the
soldiers
who
had
been
awakened
were
already
going
back
to
sleep
captain
colden
sat
down
on
a
log
and
waited
for
them
to
state
their
wants
then
robert
spoke
knowing
they
could
not
afford
to
delay
we
thank
you
captain
colden
he
said
for
the
offer
of
supper
and
bed
but
i
must
say
to
you
sir
that
its
no
time
for
either
i
dont
take
your
meaning
mr
lennox
tayoga
mr
willet
and
black
rifle
are
the
best
scouts
in
the
wilderness
and
before
sunset
they
saw
smoke
on
the
horizon
then
they
saw
smoke
answering
smoke
and
black
rifle
has
seen
more
the
french
and
indians
sir
are
in
the
forest
and
theyre
led
too
by
frenchmen
young
james
colden
was
a
brave
man
and
his
eyes
glittered
we
ask
nothing
better
than
to
meet
em
he
said
at
the
first
breath
of
dawn
well
march
against
em
if
your
friends
will
only
be
so
good
as
to
show
us
the
way
its
not
a
matter
of
waiting
until
dawn
nor
even
of
going
to
meet
em
theyll
bring
the
battle
to
us
you
and
your
force
captain
colden
are
surrounded
already
the
young
captain
stared
at
robert
but
his
eyes
were
full
of
incredulity
several
of
the
soldiers
were
standing
near
and
they
too
heard
but
the
warning
found
no
answer
in
their
minds
robert
looked
around
at
the
men
asleep
and
the
others
ready
to
follow
them
and
despite
his
instinctive
liking
for
colden
his
anger
began
to
rise
i
said
that
you
were
surrounded
he
repeated
sharply
and
its
no
time
captain
colden
for
unbelief
mr
willet
tayoga
and
i
saw
the
signals
of
the
enemy
but
black
rifle
here
has
looked
upon
the
warriors
themselves
theyre
led
too
by
the
french
and
the
best
of
all
the
french
forest
captains
st
luc
is
undoubtedly
with
them
off
there
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
north
and
a
little
of
the
high
color
left
coldens
face
the
youths
manner
was
so
earnest
and
his
words
were
spoken
with
so
much
power
of
conviction
that
they
could
not
fail
to
impress
you
really
mean
that
the
french
and
indians
are
here
that
theyre
planning
to
attack
us
tonight
said
the
philadelphian
beyond
a
doubt
and
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
them
colden
took
a
few
steps
back
and
forth
and
then
like
the
brave
young
man
he
was
he
swallowed
his
pride
i
confess
that
i
dont
know
much
of
the
forest
nor
do
my
men
he
said
and
so
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
four
to
help
me
well
do
it
gladly
said
robert
what
do
you
propose
dave
i
think
wed
better
draw
off
some
distance
from
the
fire
replied
the
hunter
to
the
right
there
is
a
low
hill
covered
with
thick
brush
and
old
logs
thrown
down
by
an
ancient
storm
its
the
very
place
then
said
captain
colden
briskly
well
occupy
it
inside
of
five
minutes
up
men
up
the
sleepers
were
awakened
rapidly
and
although
they
were
awkward
and
made
much
more
noise
than
was
necessary
they
obeyed
their
captains
sharp
order
and
marched
away
with
all
their
arms
and
stores
to
the
thicket
on
the
hill
where
as
willet
had
predicted
they
found
also
a
network
of
fallen
trees
affording
a
fine
shelter
and
defense
here
they
crouched
and
willet
enjoined
upon
them
the
necessity
of
silence
sir
said
young
captain
colden
again
putting
down
his
pride
i
beg
to
thank
you
and
your
comrades
you
dont
owe
us
any
thanks
its
just
what
we
ought
to
have
done
said
willet
lightly
the
wilderness
often
turns
a
false
face
to
those
who
are
not
used
to
it
and
if
we
hadnt
warned
you
wed
have
deserved
shooting
the
faint
whine
of
a
wolf
came
from
a
point
far
in
the
north
its
one
of
their
signals
said
willet
theyll
attack
inside
of
an
hour
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
and
waited
every
heart
beating
hard
chapter
ii
the
ambush
robert
now
had
much
experience
of
indian
attack
and
forest
warfare
but
it
always
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
his
vivid
and
uncommon
imagination
the
great
pulses
in
his
throat
and
temples
leaped
and
his
ear
became
so
keen
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
hear
the
fall
of
the
leaf
in
the
forest
it
was
this
acute
sharpening
of
the
senses
the
painting
of
pictures
before
him
that
gave
him
the
gift
of
golden
speech
that
the
indians
had
first
noticed
in
him
he
saw
and
heard
much
that
others
could
neither
hear
nor
see
and
the
words
to
describe
it
were
always
ready
to
pour
forth
willet
and
tayoga
were
crouched
near
him
their
rifles
thrust
forward
a
little
and
just
beyond
them
was
captain
colden
who
had
drawn
a
small
sword
more
as
an
evidence
of
command
than
as
a
weapon
the
men
city
bred
were
silent
but
the
faces
of
some
of
them
still
expressed
amazement
and
incredulity
roberts
quick
and
powerful
imagination
instantly
projected
itself
into
their
minds
and
he
saw
as
they
saw
to
them
the
cry
of
a
wolf
was
the
cry
of
a
real
wolf
the
forest
was
dark
lonely
and
uncomfortable
but
it
was
empty
of
any
foe
and
the
four
who
had
come
to
them
were
merely
trying
to
create
a
sense
of
their
own
importance
they
began
to
move
restlessly
and
it
required
captain
coldens
whispered
but
sharp
command
to
still
them
again
the
cry
of
the
wolf
used
much
by
both
the
indians
and
the
borderers
as
a
signal
came
now
from
the
east
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
minute
it
was
repeated
from
the
west
call
and
answer
were
a
relief
to
robert
whose
faculties
were
attuned
to
such
a
high
degree
that
any
relief
to
the
strain
though
it
brought
the
certainty
of
attack
was
welcome
youre
sure
those
cries
were
made
by
our
enemies
said
young
colden
beyond
a
doubt
replied
willet
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
note
and
that
of
a
genuine
wolf
but
then
ive
spent
many
years
in
the
wilderness
and
i
had
to
learn
these
things
in
order
to
live
theyll
send
forward
scouts
and
theyll
expect
to
find
you
and
your
men
around
the
fire
most
of
you
asleep
when
they
miss
you
there
theyll
try
to
locate
you
and
theyll
soon
trail
us
to
these
bushes
captain
james
colden
had
his
share
of
pride
and
much
faith
in
himself
but
he
had
nobility
of
soul
too
i
believe
you
implicitly
mr
willet
he
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
and
your
friends
the
enemy
would
have
been
upon
us
when
we
expected
him
not
at
all
and
tis
most
likely
that
all
of
us
would
have
been
killed
and
scalped
so
i
thank
you
now
lest
i
fall
in
the
battle
and
it
be
too
late
then
to
express
my
gratitude
it
was
a
little
bit
formal
and
a
little
bit
youthful
but
willet
accepted
the
words
in
the
fine
spirit
in
which
they
were
uttered
what
we
did
was
no
more
than
we
should
have
done
he
replied
and
youll
pay
us
back
in
such
times
as
these
everybody
ought
to
help
everybody
else
caution
your
soldiers
captain
wont
you
not
to
make
any
noise
at
all
the
wolf
will
howl
no
more
and
i
fancy
their
scouts
are
now
within
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
the
fire
im
glad
its
turned
darker
the
troop
hidden
in
the
bushes
was
now
completely
silent
the
philadelphia
men
used
to
contiguous
houses
and
streets
were
not
afraid
but
they
were
appalled
by
their
extraordinary
position
at
night
in
the
deep
brush
of
an
unknown
wilderness
with
a
creeping
foe
coming
down
upon
them
many
a
hand
quivered
upon
the
rifle
barrel
but
the
heart
of
its
owner
did
not
tremble
the
moonlight
was
scant
and
the
stars
were
few
to
the
city
men
trees
and
bushes
melted
together
in
a
general
blackness
relieved
only
by
a
single
point
of
light
where
the
fire
yet
smoldered
but
robert
kneeling
by
the
side
of
tayoga
saw
with
his
trained
eyes
the
separate
trunks
stretching
away
like
columns
and
then
far
beyond
the
fire
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
red
feather
raised
for
a
moment
above
the
undergrowth
did
you
see
he
whispered
to
tayoga
yes
it
was
a
painted
feather
in
the
scalp
lock
of
a
huron
replied
the
onondaga
and
where
he
is
others
are
sure
to
be
well
spoken
dagaeoga
they
have
discovered
already
that
the
soldiers
are
not
by
the
fire
and
now
they
will
search
for
them
they
will
lie
almost
flat
on
their
faces
and
follow
a
little
the
broad
trail
the
city
men
have
left
doubtless
dagaeoga
willet
had
already
warned
captain
colden
and
the
soldiers
were
ready
tayoga
was
on
roberts
right
and
on
his
left
was
black
rifle
to
whom
his
attention
was
now
attracted
the
mans
eyes
were
blazing
in
his
dark
face
and
his
crouched
figure
was
tense
like
that
of
a
lion
about
to
spring
face
and
attitude
alike
expressed
the
most
eager
anticipation
and
robert
shuddered
the
ranger
would
add
more
lives
to
the
toll
of
his
revenge
and
yet
the
youth
felt
sympathy
for
him
too
then
his
mind
became
wholly
absorbed
in
the
battle
which
obviously
was
so
close
at
hand
their
position
was
strong
just
behind
them
the
thickets
ended
in
a
cliff
hard
to
climb
and
on
the
right
was
an
open
space
that
the
enemy
could
not
cross
without
being
seen
hence
the
chief
danger
was
in
front
and
on
the
left
and
most
of
the
men
watched
those
points
i
can
see
the
bushes
moving
about
a
hundred
yards
away
whispered
tayoga
a
warrior
is
there
but
to
fire
at
him
would
be
shooting
at
random
let
them
begin
it
theyll
open
soon
theyll
know
by
our
absence
from
the
fire
that
were
looking
for
em
spoken
well
dagaeoga
youll
be
a
warrior
some
day
robert
smiled
in
the
dark
tayoga
himself
was
so
great
a
warrior
that
he
could
preserve
his
sense
of
humor
upon
the
eve
of
a
deadly
battle
robert
also
saw
bushes
moving
now
but
nothing
was
definite
enough
for
a
shot
and
he
waited
with
his
fingers
on
the
trigger
the
enemy
is
at
hand
captain
colden
said
willet
if
you
will
look
very
closely
at
the
thicket
about
one
hundred
yards
directly
in
front
of
us
youll
see
the
leaves
shaking
yes
i
can
make
out
some
movement
there
said
colden
theyve
discovered
of
course
that
weve
left
the
fire
and
they
know
also
where
we
are
do
you
think
theyll
try
to
rush
us
not
at
all
its
not
the
indian
way
nor
is
it
the
way
either
of
the
french
who
go
with
them
they
know
your
men
are
rawpardon
meinexperienced
troops
and
theyll
put
a
cruel
burden
upon
your
patience
they
may
wait
for
hours
and
theyll
try
in
every
manner
to
wear
them
out
and
to
provoke
them
at
last
into
some
rash
movement
youll
have
to
guard
most
captain
colden
against
the
temper
of
your
troop
if
youll
take
advice
from
one
whos
a
veteran
in
the
woods
youd
better
threaten
them
with
death
for
disobedience
of
orders
as
i
said
before
im
grateful
to
you
for
any
advice
or
suggestion
mr
willet
this
seems
a
long
way
from
philadelphia
and
ill
confess
im
not
so
very
much
at
home
here
he
crawled
among
his
men
and
willet
and
robert
heard
him
threatening
them
in
fierce
whispers
and
their
replies
that
they
would
be
cautious
and
patient
it
was
well
that
willet
had
given
the
advice
as
a
full
hour
passed
without
any
sign
from
the
foe
troops
even
more
experienced
than
the
city
men
might
well
have
concluded
it
was
a
false
alarm
and
that
the
forest
contained
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
bear
there
was
no
sound
and
captain
colden
himself
asked
if
the
warriors
had
not
gone
away
not
a
chance
of
it
replied
willet
they
think
theyre
certain
of
a
victory
and
they
would
not
dream
of
retiring
and
we
have
more
long
waiting
in
the
dark
to
do
i
warned
you
there
is
no
other
way
to
fight
such
enemies
we
must
never
make
the
mistake
of
undervaluing
them
captain
colden
sighed
he
had
a
gallant
heart
and
he
and
his
troop
had
made
a
fine
parade
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
before
he
started
for
the
frontier
but
he
had
expected
to
meet
the
french
in
the
open
perhaps
with
a
bugle
playing
and
he
would
charge
at
the
head
of
his
men
waving
the
neat
small
sword
now
buckled
to
his
side
instead
he
lay
in
a
black
thicket
awaiting
the
attack
of
creeping
savages
nevertheless
he
put
down
his
pride
for
the
third
time
and
resolved
to
trust
the
four
who
had
come
so
opportunely
to
his
aid
and
who
seemed
to
be
so
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
wilderness
another
hour
dragged
its
weary
length
away
and
there
was
no
sound
of
anything
stirring
in
the
forest
the
skies
lightened
a
little
as
the
moon
came
out
casting
a
faint
whitish
tint
over
trees
and
bushes
but
the
brave
young
captain
was
yet
unable
to
see
any
trace
of
the
enemy
do
you
feel
quite
sure
that
were
still
besieged
he
whispered
to
willet
yes
captain
replied
the
hunter
and
as
i
said
patience
is
the
commodity
we
need
most
it
would
be
fatal
for
us
to
force
the
action
but
i
dont
think
we
have
much
longer
to
wait
since
they
cant
induce
us
to
take
some
rash
step
theyre
likely
to
make
a
movement
soon
i
see
the
bushes
waving
again
said
tayoga
it
is
proof
that
the
warriors
are
approaching
it
would
be
well
for
the
soldiers
to
lie
flat
for
a
little
while
captain
colden
adhering
to
his
resolution
to
take
the
advice
of
his
new
friends
crept
along
the
line
telling
the
men
in
sharp
whispers
to
hug
the
earth
a
command
that
they
obeyed
willingly
as
the
darkness
the
silence
and
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
danger
had
begun
to
weigh
heavily
upon
their
nerves
robert
saw
a
bead
of
flame
among
the
bushes
and
heard
a
sharp
report
a
bullet
cut
a
bough
over
his
head
and
a
leaf
drifted
down
upon
his
face
the
soldiers
shifted
uneasily
and
began
to
thrust
their
rifles
forward
but
again
the
stern
command
of
the
young
captain
prompted
by
the
hunter
held
them
down
twas
intended
merely
to
draw
us
said
willet
theyre
sure
were
in
this
wood
but
of
course
they
dont
know
the
exact
location
of
our
men
theyre
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
the
bright
uniforms
but
if
the
men
keep
very
low
they
wont
get
it
it
was
a
tremendous
trial
for
young
and
raw
troops
but
they
managed
to
still
their
nerves
and
to
remain
crouched
and
motionless
a
second
shot
was
fired
soon
and
then
a
third
but
like
the
first
they
were
trial
bullets
and
both
went
high
black
rifle
grew
impatient
the
memory
of
his
murdered
family
began
to
press
upon
him
once
more
the
night
was
black
but
now
it
looked
red
to
him
lying
almost
flat
he
slowly
pulled
himself
forward
like
a
great
wild
beast
stalking
its
prey
colden
looked
at
him
and
then
at
willet
who
nodded
dont
try
to
stop
him
whispered
the
hunter
because
hell
go
anyhow
besides
its
time
for
us
to
reply
to
their
shots
the
dark
form
moving
forward
without
noise
had
a
singular
fascination
for
robert
his
imagination
which
colored
and
magnified
everything
made
black
rifle
sinister
and
supernatural
the
complete
absence
of
sound
as
he
advanced
heightened
the
effect
not
a
leaf
nor
a
blade
of
grass
rustled
presently
he
stopped
and
robert
saw
the
black
muzzle
of
his
rifle
shoot
forward
a
stream
of
flame
leaped
forth
and
then
the
man
quickly
slid
into
a
new
position
a
fierce
shout
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
a
half
dozen
shots
were
fired
bullets
again
cut
twigs
and
leaves
over
roberts
head
but
all
of
them
went
too
high
do
you
think
black
rifle
hit
his
mark
whispered
robert
to
tayoga
it
is
likely
replied
the
onondaga
but
we
may
never
know
i
think
it
would
be
well
dagaeoga
for
you
and
me
to
go
toward
the
left
they
may
try
to
creep
around
our
flank
and
we
must
meet
them
there
willet
and
colden
approved
of
the
plan
and
a
half
dozen
of
the
best
soldiers
went
with
them
the
movement
proving
to
be
wise
as
within
five
minutes
a
scattering
fire
was
opened
upon
that
point
the
soldiers
fired
two
rash
shots
merely
aiming
at
the
reports
and
the
general
blackness
but
robert
and
tayoga
quickly
reduced
them
to
control
insisting
that
they
wait
until
they
saw
a
foe
before
pulling
trigger
again
then
they
sank
back
among
the
bushes
and
remained
quite
still
tayoga
suddenly
drew
a
deep
and
very
long
breath
which
with
him
was
equivalent
to
an
exclamation
what
is
it
tayoga
asked
robert
i
saw
a
bit
of
a
uniform
and
i
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
an
officer
then
we
were
right
in
our
surmise
that
the
french
are
here
leading
the
warriors
it
was
but
a
glimpse
but
it
showed
the
curve
of
his
jaw
and
chin
and
i
knew
him
he
is
one
who
is
beginning
to
be
important
in
your
life
dagaeoga
st
luc
none
other
i
could
not
be
mistaken
he
is
leading
the
attack
upon
us
perhaps
tandakora
is
with
him
the
frenchman
does
not
like
the
ojibway
but
war
makes
strange
comrades
that
was
close
a
bullet
whistled
directly
between
them
and
tayoga
kneeling
fired
in
return
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
aim
as
a
warrior
uttered
the
death
cry
and
a
fierce
shout
of
rage
from
a
dozen
throats
followed
robert
imaginative
ready
to
flame
up
in
a
moment
exulted
not
because
a
warrior
had
fallen
but
because
the
flank
attack
upon
his
own
people
had
been
stopped
in
the
beginning
st
luc
himself
would
have
admitted
that
the
americans
or
the
english
as
he
would
have
called
them
were
acting
wisely
the
soldiers
stirred
by
the
successful
shot
showed
again
a
great
desire
to
fire
at
the
black
woods
but
robert
and
the
onondaga
still
kept
them
down
a
crackling
fire
arose
behind
them
showing
that
the
main
force
had
engaged
and
now
and
then
the
warriors
uttered
defiant
cries
but
robert
had
enough
power
of
will
to
watch
in
front
sure
that
willet
and
black
rifle
were
sufficient
to
guide
the
central
defense
he
observed
intently
the
segment
of
the
circle
in
front
of
them
and
he
wondered
if
st
luc
would
appear
there
again
but
he
concluded
that
he
would
not
since
the
failure
of
the
attempted
surprise
at
that
point
would
be
likely
to
send
him
back
to
the
main
force
do
you
think
theyll
go
away
and
concentrate
in
front
he
asked
tayoga
no
replied
the
onondaga
they
still
think
perhaps
that
they
have
only
the
soldiers
from
the
city
to
meet
and
they
may
attempt
a
rush
robert
crept
from
soldier
to
soldier
cautioning
every
one
to
take
shelter
and
to
have
his
rifle
ready
and
they
being
good
men
though
without
experience
obeyed
the
one
who
so
obviously
knew
what
he
was
doing
meantime
the
combat
behind
them
proceeded
with
vigor
the
shots
crashing
in
volleys
accompanied
by
shouts
and
once
by
the
cry
of
a
stricken
soldier
it
was
evident
that
st
luc
was
now
pushing
the
battle
and
robert
was
quite
sure
the
attack
on
the
flank
would
soon
come
again
they
did
not
wait
much
longer
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
from
the
undergrowth
and
rushed
straight
toward
them
a
white
man
now
in
front
the
light
was
sufficient
for
robert
to
see
that
the
leader
was
not
st
luc
and
then
without
hesitation
he
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
the
man
fell
tayoga
stopped
the
rush
of
a
warrior
and
the
bullets
of
the
soldiers
wounded
others
but
their
white
leader
was
gone
and
indians
have
little
love
for
an
attack
upon
a
sheltered
enemy
so
the
charge
broke
before
it
was
half
way
to
the
defenders
and
the
savages
vanished
in
the
thickets
the
soldiers
began
to
exult
but
robert
bade
them
reload
as
fast
as
possible
and
keep
well
under
cover
the
warriors
from
new
points
would
fire
at
every
exposed
head
and
they
could
not
afford
to
relax
their
caution
for
an
instant
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
youthful
veterans
of
the
forest
to
keep
the
older
but
inexperienced
men
from
the
city
under
cover
they
had
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
see
the
indians
who
were
shooting
at
them
and
against
whom
they
were
sending
their
bullets
in
spite
of
every
command
and
entreaty
a
man
would
raise
his
head
now
and
then
and
one
as
he
did
so
received
a
bullet
between
the
eyes
falling
back
quietly
dead
before
he
touched
the
ground
a
brave
lad
has
been
lost
whispered
tayoga
to
robert
but
he
has
been
an
involuntary
example
to
the
rest
the
onondaga
spoke
in
his
precise
school
english
but
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
as
the
soldiers
now
became
much
more
cautious
and
controlled
their
impulse
to
raise
up
for
a
look
after
every
shot
another
man
was
wounded
but
the
hurt
was
not
serious
and
he
went
on
with
his
firing
robert
seeing
that
the
line
on
the
flank
could
be
held
without
great
difficulty
left
tayoga
in
command
and
crept
back
to
the
main
force
where
the
bullets
were
coming
much
faster
two
of
the
soldiers
in
the
center
had
been
slain
and
three
had
been
wounded
but
captain
colden
had
not
given
ground
he
was
sitting
behind
a
rocky
outcrop
and
at
the
suggestion
of
willet
was
giving
orders
to
his
men
oppressed
at
first
by
the
ambush
and
weight
of
responsibility
he
was
exulting
now
in
their
ability
to
check
the
savage
onset
robert
was
quite
willing
to
play
a
little
to
his
pride
and
he
said
in
the
formal
military
manner
i
wish
to
report
sir
that
all
is
going
well
on
the
southern
flank
one
of
our
men
has
been
killed
but
we
have
made
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
advance
there
thank
you
mr
lennox
said
the
young
captain
with
dignity
we
have
also
had
some
success
here
due
chiefly
to
the
good
advice
of
mr
willet
and
the
prowess
and
sharpshooting
of
the
extraordinary
man
whom
you
call
black
rifle
see
him
now
he
indicated
a
dark
figure
a
little
distance
ahead
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
as
robert
looked
a
jet
of
fire
leaped
from
the
muzzle
of
the
mans
rifle
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
cry
in
the
forest
i
think
he
has
slain
more
of
our
enemies
than
the
rest
of
us
combined
said
captain
colden
robert
shuddered
a
little
but
those
who
lived
on
the
border
became
used
to
strange
things
the
constant
struggle
for
existence
hardened
the
nerves
and
terrible
scenes
did
not
dwell
long
in
the
mind
he
bent
forward
for
a
better
look
and
a
bullet
cut
the
hair
upon
his
forehead
he
started
back
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
seared
by
lightning
and
willet
looked
at
him
anxiously
the
lead
burned
as
it
passed
the
lad
said
but
the
skin
is
not
broken
i
was
guilty
of
the
same
rashness
for
which
i
have
been
lecturing
the
men
on
the
flank
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
who
fired
the
shot
said
willet
i
think
it
was
the
canadian
dubois
whom
we
saw
with
st
luc
tayoga
saw
st
luc
himself
on
the
flank
said
robert
and
so
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
leading
the
attack
the
fact
makes
it
certain
that
it
will
be
carried
on
with
persistence
we
shall
be
here
still
besieged
when
day
comes
said
the
hunter
its
lucky
that
the
cliff
protects
us
on
one
side
as
if
to
disprove
his
assertion
all
the
firing
stopped
suddenly
and
for
a
long
time
the
forest
was
silent
fortunately
they
had
water
in
their
canteens
and
they
were
able
to
soothe
the
thirst
of
the
wounded
men
they
talked
also
of
victory
and
knowing
that
it
was
only
two
or
three
hours
until
dawn
captain
coldens
spirits
rose
to
great
heights
he
was
sure
now
that
the
warriors
defeated
had
gone
away
this
frenchman
st
luc
of
whom
they
talked
might
be
a
great
partisan
leader
but
he
would
know
when
the
price
he
was
paying
became
too
high
and
would
draw
off
the
men
believed
their
captain
and
despite
the
earnest
protest
of
the
foresters
began
to
stir
in
the
bushes
shortly
before
dawn
a
rifle
shot
came
from
the
opposing
thickets
and
one
of
them
would
stir
no
more
captain
colden
appalled
was
all
remorse
he
took
the
death
of
the
man
directly
to
himself
and
told
willet
with
emotion
that
all
advice
of
his
would
now
be
taken
at
once
let
the
men
lie
as
close
as
they
can
said
the
hunter
the
day
will
soon
be
here
robert
found
shelter
behind
the
trunk
of
a
huge
oak
and
crouched
there
his
nerves
relaxing
he
did
not
believe
any
further
movement
of
the
enemy
would
come
now
as
the
great
tension
passed
for
a
time
he
was
conscious
of
an
immense
weariness
the
strain
upon
all
the
physical
senses
and
upon
the
mind
as
well
made
him
weak
it
was
a
luxury
merely
to
sit
there
with
his
back
against
the
bark
and
rest
near
him
he
heard
the
soldiers
moving
softly
and
now
and
then
a
wounded
man
asking
for
water
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
it
had
upon
his
face
the
freshness
of
the
dawn
he
wondered
what
the
day
would
bring
the
light
that
came
with
it
would
be
cheerful
and
uplifting
but
it
would
disclose
their
covert
at
least
in
part
and
st
luc
might
lead
both
french
and
indians
in
one
great
rush
better
eat
a
little
said
tayoga
who
had
returned
to
the
center
remember
that
we
have
plenty
of
food
in
our
knapsacks
nor
are
our
canteens
empty
i
had
forgotten
it
said
robert
and
he
ate
and
drank
sparingly
the
breeze
continued
to
freshen
and
in
the
east
the
dawn
broke
gray
turning
to
silver
and
then
to
red
and
gold
the
forest
soon
stood
out
an
infinite
tracery
in
the
dazzling
light
and
then
a
white
fleck
appeared
against
the
wall
of
green
a
flag
of
truce
exclaimed
captain
colden
what
can
they
want
to
say
to
us
let
the
bearer
of
the
flag
appear
first
suggested
willet
and
then
well
talk
with
em
the
figure
of
a
man
holding
up
a
white
handkerchief
appeared
and
it
was
st
luc
himself
as
neat
and
irreproachable
as
if
he
were
attending
a
ball
in
the
intendants
palace
at
quebec
robert
knew
that
he
must
have
been
active
in
the
battle
all
through
the
night
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
it
he
wore
a
fine
closefitting
uniform
of
dark
blue
and
the
handkerchief
of
lace
was
held
aloft
on
the
point
of
a
small
sword
the
golden
hilt
of
which
glittered
in
the
morning
sunlight
he
was
a
strange
figure
in
the
forest
but
a
most
gallant
one
and
to
roberts
eyes
a
chevalier
without
fear
and
without
reproach
i
know
that
you
speak
good
french
mr
lennox
said
captain
colden
will
you
go
forward
and
meet
the
frenchman
you
will
perhaps
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
if
not
you
can
refer
to
mr
willet
and
myself
i
will
do
my
best
sir
said
robert
glad
of
the
chance
to
meet
st
luc
face
to
face
again
he
did
not
know
why
his
heart
leaped
so
every
time
he
saw
the
chevalier
but
his
friendship
for
him
was
undeniable
it
seemed
too
that
st
luc
liked
him
and
robert
felt
sure
that
whatever
hostility
his
official
enemy
felt
for
the
english
cause
there
was
none
for
him
personally
unconsciously
he
began
to
arrange
his
own
attire
of
forest
green
beautifully
dyed
and
decorated
deerskin
that
he
might
not
look
less
neat
than
the
man
whom
he
was
going
to
meet
st
luc
was
standing
under
the
wide
boughs
of
an
oak
his
gold
hilted
rapier
returned
to
its
sheath
and
his
white
lace
handkerchief
to
its
pocket
the
smile
of
welcome
upon
his
face
as
he
saw
the
herald
was
genuine
i
salute
you
mr
lennox
he
said
and
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
i
learned
that
you
were
in
the
force
besieged
by
us
and
its
a
pleasure
to
see
that
youve
escaped
unhurt
when
last
we
met
the
honors
were
yours
you
fairly
defeated
me
at
the
word
play
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
you
will
admit
that
the
savage
tandakora
played
into
your
hands
most
opportunely
you
will
admit
also
that
word
play
is
not
sword
play
and
that
in
the
appeal
to
the
sword
we
have
the
advantage
of
you
it
may
seem
so
to
one
who
sees
with
your
eyes
and
from
your
position
said
robert
but
being
myself
im
compelled
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
from
our
side
i
wish
to
say
first
however
chevalier
de
st
luc
that
since
you
have
wished
me
a
very
good
morning
i
even
wish
you
a
better
st
luc
laughed
gayly
you
and
i
will
never
be
enemies
it
would
be
against
nature
he
said
no
well
never
be
enemies
but
why
is
it
against
nature
perhaps
i
was
not
happy
in
my
phrase
we
like
each
other
too
well
andin
a
wayour
temperaments
resemble
too
much
to
engender
a
mutual
hate
but
well
to
business
mines
a
mission
of
mercy
i
come
to
receive
the
surrender
of
your
friends
and
yourself
since
continued
resistance
to
us
will
be
vain
robert
smiled
his
gift
of
golden
speech
was
again
making
its
presence
felt
he
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
before
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
they
had
spoken
where
all
might
hear
now
they
two
alone
could
hear
but
he
felt
that
the
test
was
the
same
in
kind
he
knew
that
his
friends
in
the
thickets
behind
him
were
watching
and
he
was
equally
sure
that
french
and
savages
in
the
thickets
before
him
were
watching
too
he
had
no
doubt
the
baleful
eyes
of
tandakora
were
glaring
at
him
at
that
very
moment
and
that
the
fingers
of
the
ojibway
were
eager
to
grasp
his
scalp
the
idea
singularly
enough
caused
him
amusement
because
his
imagination
vivid
as
usual
leaped
far
ahead
and
he
foresaw
that
his
hair
would
never
become
a
trophy
for
tandakora
you
smile
mr
lennox
said
st
luc
do
you
find
my
words
so
amusing
not
amusing
chevalier
oh
no
and
if
in
truth
i
found
them
so
i
would
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
smile
but
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
your
official
enemy
has
underrated
the
strength
of
your
position
that
is
why
my
eyes
expressed
contenti
would
scarcely
call
it
a
smile
i
see
once
more
that
youre
a
master
of
words
mr
lennox
you
play
with
them
as
the
wind
sports
among
the
leaves
but
i
dont
speak
in
jest
monsieur
de
st
luc
im
not
in
command
here
im
merely
a
spokesman
a
herald
or
a
messenger
in
whichever
way
you
should
choose
to
define
me
captain
james
colden
a
gallant
young
officer
of
philadelphia
is
our
leader
but
in
this
instance
i
dont
feel
the
need
of
consulting
him
i
know
that
your
offer
is
kindly
that
it
comes
from
a
generous
soul
but
however
much
it
may
disappoint
you
i
must
decline
it
our
resistance
in
the
night
has
been
quite
successful
we
have
inflicted
upon
you
much
more
damage
than
you
have
inflicted
upon
us
and
ive
no
doubt
the
day
will
witness
a
battle
continued
in
the
same
proportion
st
luc
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
not
loud
but
gayly
and
with
unction
robert
reddened
but
he
could
not
take
offense
as
he
saw
that
none
was
meant
i
no
longer
wonder
at
my
defeat
by
you
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
said
the
chevalier
since
youre
not
merely
a
master
of
words
youre
a
masterartist
ive
no
doubt
if
i
listen
to
you
youll
persuade
me
its
not
you
but
we
who
are
besieged
and
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
yield
to
you
without
further
ado
perhaps
youre
not
so
very
far
wrong
said
robert
recovering
his
assurance
which
was
nearly
always
great
im
sure
captain
colden
would
receive
your
surrender
and
treat
you
well
the
eyes
of
the
two
met
and
twinkled
tandakora
is
with
us
said
st
luc
and
ive
a
notion
he
wouldnt
relish
it
perhaps
he
distrusts
the
mercy
he
would
receive
at
the
hands
of
your
onondaga
tayoga
and
at
this
point
in
our
dialogue
mr
lennox
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
again
for
the
actions
of
the
ojibway
before
the
war
really
began
i
couldnt
prevent
them
but
since
there
is
genuine
war
he
is
our
ally
and
i
must
accord
to
him
all
the
dignities
and
honors
appertaining
to
his
position
youre
rather
deft
with
words
yourself
monsieur
de
st
luc
once
at
new
york
i
saw
a
juggler
with
balls
who
could
keep
five
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
and
in
some
dim
and
remote
way
you
make
me
think
of
him
youll
pardon
the
illustration
chevalier
because
i
really
mean
it
as
a
compliment
i
pardon
gladly
enough
because
i
see
your
intentions
are
good
we
both
play
with
words
perhaps
because
the
exercise
tickles
our
fancy
but
to
return
to
the
true
spirit
and
essence
of
things
i
warn
you
that
it
would
be
wise
to
surrender
my
force
is
very
much
greater
than
captain
coldens
and
has
him
hemmed
in
if
my
indian
allies
suffer
too
much
in
the
attack
it
will
be
difficult
to
restrain
them
im
not
stating
this
as
a
threatyou
know
me
too
well
for
thatbut
to
make
the
facts
plain
and
to
avoid
something
that
i
should
regret
as
much
as
you
i
dont
think
it
necessary
to
consult
captain
colden
and
without
doing
so
i
decline
your
offer
we
have
food
to
eat
water
to
drink
and
bullets
to
shoot
and
if
you
care
to
take
us
you
must
come
and
do
so
and
that
is
the
final
answer
youre
quite
sure
you
dont
wish
to
consult
your
superior
officer
captain
colden
absolutely
sure
it
would
waste
the
time
of
all
of
us
then
it
seems
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
and
to
use
your
own
fanciful
way
of
putting
it
we
must
go
back
from
the
play
of
words
to
the
play
of
swords
i
see
no
alternative
and
yet
i
hope
that
you
will
survive
the
combat
mr
lennox
ive
the
same
hope
for
you
chevalier
de
st
luc
each
meant
it
and
in
the
same
high
manner
of
the
day
they
saluted
and
withdrew
robert
as
he
walked
back
to
the
thickets
in
which
the
defenders
lay
felt
that
indian
eyes
were
upon
him
and
that
perhaps
an
indian
bullet
would
speed
toward
him
despite
st
luc
tandakora
and
the
savages
around
him
could
not
always
be
controlled
by
their
french
allies
as
was
to
be
shown
too
often
in
this
war
his
sensitive
mind
once
more
turned
fancy
into
reality
and
the
hair
on
his
head
lifted
a
little
but
pride
would
not
let
him
hasten
his
steps
no
gun
was
fired
and
with
an
immense
relief
he
sank
down
behind
a
fallen
log
and
by
the
side
of
colden
and
willet
what
did
the
frenchman
want
asked
the
young
captain
our
instant
and
unconditional
surrender
knowing
how
you
felt
about
it
i
gave
him
your
refusal
at
once
well
done
mr
lennox
he
said
that
in
case
of
a
rush
and
heavy
loss
by
his
indians
he
perhaps
would
not
be
able
to
control
them
in
the
moment
of
victory
which
doubtless
is
true
they
will
know
no
moment
of
victory
we
can
hold
them
off
where
is
tayoga
asked
robert
of
willet
the
hunter
pointed
westward
why
the
cliff
shuts
off
the
way
in
that
direction
said
robert
not
to
a
good
climber
do
you
mean
then
that
tayoga
is
gone
i
saw
him
go
he
went
while
you
were
talking
with
st
luc
why
should
tayoga
leave
us
he
saw
another
smoke
against
the
sky
it
was
but
a
faint
trace
only
an
extremely
keen
eye
would
have
noticed
it
and
having
much
natural
curiosity
tayoga
is
now
on
his
way
to
see
who
built
the
fire
that
made
the
smoke
and
it
may
have
been
made
by
friends
thats
our
hope
robert
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
toward
the
west
the
sky
was
now
clear
there
but
he
knew
that
tayoga
could
not
have
made
any
mistake
then
his
heart
high
once
more
he
settled
himself
down
to
wait
chapter
iii
the
signal
the
day
advanced
brilliant
with
sunshine
and
the
forces
of
st
luc
were
quiet
for
a
long
time
not
a
shot
was
fired
and
it
seemed
to
the
besieged
that
the
forest
was
empty
of
human
beings
save
themselves
robert
did
not
believe
the
french
leader
would
attempt
a
long
siege
since
an
engagement
could
not
be
conducted
in
that
manner
in
the
forest
where
a
result
of
some
kind
must
be
reached
soon
yet
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
plan
st
luc
had
in
mind
and
they
must
wait
until
tayoga
came
young
captain
colden
was
in
good
spirits
it
was
his
first
taste
of
wilderness
warfare
and
he
knew
that
he
had
done
well
the
dead
were
laid
decently
among
the
bushes
to
receive
christian
burial
later
if
the
chance
came
and
the
wounded
their
hurts
bound
up
prepared
to
take
what
part
they
could
in
a
new
battle
robert
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
looked
toward
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
saw
only
a
dazzling
blue
sky
unflecked
by
anything
save
little
white
clouds
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
mission
of
his
young
onondaga
comrade
would
have
any
success
he
crept
back
to
the
side
of
willet
have
you
any
opinion
dave
about
the
smoke
that
tayoga
saw
he
asked
none
robert
just
a
hope
it
might
have
been
made
by
another
french
and
indian
band
most
probably
it
was
but
there
is
a
chance
too
that
friends
built
the
fire
if
its
a
force
of
any
size
it
could
hardly
be
english
i
dont
think
any
troop
of
ours
except
captain
coldens
is
in
this
region
we
cant
look
for
help
from
our
own
race
robert
was
silent
gazing
intently
into
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
recognized
the
immense
difficulties
of
their
position
indians
if
an
attack
or
two
of
theirs
failed
would
be
likely
to
go
away
but
the
french
and
especially
st
luc
would
increase
their
persistence
and
hold
them
to
the
task
he
returned
to
the
forest
and
his
attention
was
drawn
once
more
by
black
rifle
the
man
was
lying
almost
flat
in
the
thicket
and
evidently
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
foe
as
he
was
writhing
slowly
forward
like
a
great
beast
of
prey
and
his
eyes
once
more
had
the
expectant
look
of
one
who
is
going
to
strike
robert
considered
him
he
knew
that
the
mans
whole
nature
had
been
poisoned
by
the
great
tragedy
in
his
life
and
that
it
gave
him
a
sinister
pleasure
to
inflict
blows
upon
those
who
had
inflicted
the
great
blow
upon
him
yet
he
would
be
useful
in
the
fierce
war
that
was
upon
them
and
he
was
useful
now
black
rifle
crept
forward
two
or
three
yards
more
and
after
he
had
lain
quite
still
for
a
few
moments
he
suddenly
thrust
out
his
rifle
and
fired
a
cry
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
robert
heard
the
sharpshooter
utter
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
knew
that
st
luc
was
one
warrior
less
which
was
good
for
the
defense
but
he
shuddered
a
little
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
steal
through
the
bushes
and
shoot
an
unseeing
enemy
still
black
rifle
was
black
rifle
and
being
what
he
was
he
was
not
to
be
judged
as
other
men
were
after
a
half
hours
silence
the
besiegers
suddenly
opened
fire
from
five
or
six
points
sending
perhaps
two
score
bullets
into
the
wood
clipping
off
many
twigs
and
leaves
which
fell
upon
the
heads
of
the
defenders
captain
colden
did
not
forget
to
be
grateful
to
willet
for
his
insistence
that
the
soldiers
should
always
lie
low
as
the
hostile
lead
instead
of
striking
now
merely
sent
a
harmless
shower
upon
them
but
the
fusillade
was
brief
robert
in
truth
judging
that
it
had
been
against
the
commands
of
st
luc
who
was
too
wise
a
leader
to
wish
ammunition
to
be
wasted
in
random
firing
at
the
advice
of
willet
captain
colden
would
not
let
his
men
reply
restraining
their
eagerness
and
silence
soon
returned
it
was
nearly
noon
now
and
a
huge
golden
sun
shone
over
the
vast
wilderness
in
which
two
little
bands
of
men
fought
mere
motes
in
the
limitless
sea
of
green
robert
ate
some
venison
and
drank
a
little
water
from
the
canteen
of
a
friendly
soldier
then
his
thoughts
turned
again
to
tayoga
the
onondaga
was
a
peerless
runner
he
had
been
gone
long
now
and
what
would
he
find
at
the
base
of
the
smoke
if
it
had
been
the
fire
of
an
enemy
then
he
would
be
back
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
they
would
be
in
no
worse
case
than
before
they
might
try
to
escape
in
the
night
down
the
cliff
but
it
was
not
likely
that
vigilant
foes
would
permit
men
clumsy
in
the
woods
like
the
soldiers
to
steal
away
in
such
a
manner
the
earlier
hours
of
the
afternoon
were
passed
by
the
sharpshooters
on
either
side
trying
to
stalk
one
another
although
robert
had
no
part
in
it
it
was
a
savage
play
that
alternately
fascinated
and
repelled
him
he
had
no
way
to
tell
exactly
but
he
believed
that
two
more
of
the
indians
had
fallen
while
a
soldier
received
a
wound
a
bullet
grazed
black
rifles
head
but
instead
of
daunting
him
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
kind
of
fierce
joy
and
to
inspire
in
him
a
greater
desire
to
slay
these
efforts
since
they
achieved
no
positive
results
soon
died
down
and
both
sides
lay
silent
in
their
coverts
robert
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
behind
a
log
although
he
longed
to
stand
upright
and
walk
about
once
more
like
a
human
being
it
was
now
midafternoon
and
if
the
smoke
had
meant
nothing
good
for
them
it
was
time
for
tayoga
to
be
back
it
was
not
conceivable
that
such
a
marvelous
forester
and
matchless
runner
could
have
been
taken
and
since
he
had
not
come
roberts
heart
again
beat
to
the
tune
of
hope
willet
with
whom
he
talked
a
little
was
of
like
opinion
he
looked
to
tayoga
to
bring
them
help
and
if
he
failed
their
case
already
hard
would
become
harder
the
hunter
did
not
conceal
from
himself
the
prowess
and
skill
of
st
luc
and
he
knew
too
that
the
savage
persistency
of
tandakora
was
not
to
be
held
lightly
like
robert
he
gazed
long
into
the
blue
west
which
was
flecked
only
by
little
clouds
of
white
a
sign
a
sign
he
said
if
we
could
only
behold
a
sign
but
the
heavens
said
nothing
the
sun
a
huge
ball
of
glowing
copper
was
already
far
down
the
western
curve
and
the
hunters
heart
beat
hard
with
anxiety
he
felt
that
if
help
came
it
should
come
soon
but
little
water
was
left
to
the
soldiers
although
their
food
might
last
another
day
and
the
night
itself
now
not
far
away
would
bring
the
danger
of
a
new
attack
by
a
creeping
foe
greatly
superior
in
numbers
he
turned
away
from
the
cliff
but
robert
remained
and
presently
the
youth
called
in
a
sharp
thrilling
whisper
dave
dave
come
back
robert
had
continued
to
watch
the
sky
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
faint
dark
line
against
the
sea
of
blue
he
rubbed
his
eyes
fearing
it
was
a
fault
of
vision
but
the
trace
was
still
there
and
he
believed
it
to
be
smoke
dave
dave
the
signal
look
look
he
cried
the
hunter
came
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
stared
into
the
west
a
thread
of
black
lay
across
the
blue
and
his
heart
leaped
do
you
believe
that
tayoga
has
anything
to
do
with
it
asked
robert
i
do
if
it
were
our
foes
out
there
hed
have
been
back
long
since
and
since
it
may
be
friends
theyve
sent
up
this
smoke
hoping
well
divine
what
they
mean
it
looks
like
it
tayoga
is
a
sharp
lad
and
hell
want
to
put
heart
in
the
soldiers
it
must
be
the
onondaga
and
i
wish
i
knew
what
his
smoke
was
saying
captain
colden
joined
them
and
they
pointed
out
to
him
the
trace
across
the
sky
which
was
now
broadening
explaining
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
probably
a
signal
sent
up
by
tayoga
and
that
he
might
be
leading
a
force
to
their
aid
what
help
could
he
bring
asked
the
captain
willet
shook
his
head
i
cant
answer
you
there
he
replied
but
the
smoke
has
significance
for
us
of
that
i
feel
sure
by
sundown
well
know
what
it
means
and
thats
only
about
two
hours
away
said
captain
colden
whatever
happens
well
hold
out
to
the
last
i
suppose
though
that
st
lucs
force
also
will
see
the
smoke
quite
likely
replied
willet
and
the
frenchman
may
send
a
runner
too
to
see
what
it
means
but
however
good
a
runner
he
may
be
hell
be
no
match
for
tayoga
thats
sure
said
robert
so
great
was
his
confidence
in
the
onondaga
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
killed
or
taken
and
he
awaited
his
certain
return
either
with
or
without
a
helping
force
he
lay
now
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
whence
he
could
look
toward
the
west
the
point
of
hope
whenever
he
wished
ate
another
strip
of
venison
and
took
another
drink
of
water
out
of
a
friendly
canteen
the
west
was
now
blazing
with
terraces
of
red
and
yellow
rising
above
one
another
and
the
east
was
misty
gray
and
dim
twilight
was
not
far
away
the
thread
of
smoke
that
had
lain
against
the
sky
above
the
forest
was
gone
the
glittering
bar
of
red
and
gold
being
absolutely
free
from
any
trace
st
lucs
force
opened
fire
again
bullets
clipping
twigs
and
leaves
but
the
defense
lay
quiet
except
black
rifle
who
crept
back
and
forth
continually
seeking
a
target
and
pulling
the
trigger
whenever
he
found
it
the
misty
gray
in
the
east
turned
to
darkness
in
the
west
the
sun
went
down
the
slope
of
the
world
and
the
brilliant
terraces
of
color
began
to
fade
the
firing
ceased
and
another
tense
period
of
quiet
hard
to
endure
came
at
the
suggestion
of
the
hunter
colden
drew
in
his
whole
troop
near
the
cliff
and
waited
all
despite
their
weariness
and
strain
keeping
the
keenest
watch
they
could
but
robert
instead
of
looking
toward
the
east
where
st
lucs
force
was
invariably
looked
into
the
sunset
because
it
was
there
that
tayoga
had
gone
and
it
was
there
that
they
had
seen
the
smoke
of
which
they
expected
so
much
the
terraces
of
color
already
grown
dim
were
now
fading
fast
at
the
top
they
were
gone
altogether
and
they
only
lingered
low
down
but
on
the
forest
the
red
light
yet
blazed
every
twig
and
leaf
seemed
to
stand
individual
and
distinct
black
against
a
scarlet
shield
but
it
was
for
merely
a
few
minutes
then
all
the
red
glow
disappeared
like
a
great
light
going
out
suddenly
and
the
western
forest
as
well
as
the
eastern
lay
in
a
gray
gloom
it
always
seemed
to
robert
that
the
last
going
of
the
sunset
that
day
was
like
a
signal
because
when
the
night
swept
down
black
and
complete
everywhere
there
was
a
burst
of
heavy
firing
from
the
south
and
a
long
exultant
yell
no
bullet
sped
through
the
thickets
where
the
defenders
lay
and
willet
cried
tayoga
tayoga
and
help
ah
here
they
come
the
mohawks
tayoga
panting
from
exertion
sprang
into
the
bushes
among
them
and
he
was
followed
by
a
tall
figure
in
war
paint
lofty
plumes
waving
from
his
war
bonnet
behind
him
came
many
warriors
and
others
were
already
on
the
flanks
spreading
out
like
a
fan
filing
rapidly
and
shouting
the
war
whoop
robert
recognized
at
once
the
great
figure
that
stood
before
them
it
was
daganoweda
the
young
mohawk
chief
of
his
earlier
acquaintance
whom
he
had
met
both
on
the
war
path
and
at
the
great
council
of
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
had
his
been
the
right
to
choose
the
man
who
was
to
come
to
their
aid
the
mohawk
would
have
been
his
first
choice
robert
knew
his
intense
hatred
of
the
french
and
their
red
allies
and
he
also
knew
his
fierce
courage
and
great
ability
in
battle
the
soldiers
looked
in
some
alarm
at
the
painted
host
that
had
sprung
among
them
but
willet
and
robert
assured
them
insistently
that
these
were
friends
and
the
sound
of
the
battle
they
were
already
waging
on
the
flank
with
st
lucs
force
was
proof
enough
captain
colden
said
robert
not
forgetful
that
an
indian
likes
the
courtesies
of
life
and
can
take
his
compliments
thick
this
is
the
great
young
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
which
in
our
language
means
the
inexhaustible
and
such
he
is
inexhaustible
in
resource
and
courage
in
battle
and
in
loyalty
to
his
friends
daganoweda
smiled
and
extended
his
hand
in
the
white
mans
fashion
young
colden
had
the
tact
to
shake
it
heartily
at
once
and
to
say
in
english
which
the
young
mohawk
chief
understood
perfectly
daganoweda
whatever
praise
of
you
mr
lennox
has
given
its
not
half
enough
i
confess
now
although
i
would
not
have
admitted
it
before
that
if
you
had
not
come
we
should
probably
have
been
lost
he
had
made
a
friend
for
life
and
then
without
further
words
the
two
turned
to
the
battle
but
robert
remained
for
a
minute
beside
tayoga
whose
chest
was
still
heaving
with
his
great
exertions
where
did
you
find
them
he
asked
many
miles
to
the
west
lennox
after
i
descended
the
cliff
i
was
pursued
by
huron
skirmishers
and
i
had
to
shake
them
off
then
i
ran
at
full
speed
toward
the
point
where
the
smoke
had
risen
knowing
that
the
need
was
great
and
i
overtook
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
their
first
smoke
was
but
that
from
a
campfire
as
being
in
strong
force
they
did
not
care
who
saw
them
but
the
last
just
before
the
sunset
was
sent
up
as
a
signal
by
two
warriors
whom
we
left
behind
for
the
purpose
we
thought
you
might
take
it
to
mean
that
help
was
coming
and
so
we
did
how
many
warriors
has
daganoweda
fifty
and
that
is
enough
already
they
push
the
frenchman
and
his
force
before
them
come
we
must
join
them
dagaeoga
the
breath
has
come
back
into
my
body
and
i
am
a
strong
man
again
the
two
now
quickly
took
their
places
in
the
battle
in
the
night
and
the
forest
the
position
of
the
two
forces
being
reversed
the
soldiers
and
the
mohawks
were
pushing
the
combat
at
every
point
and
the
agile
warriors
extending
themselves
on
the
flanks
had
already
driven
in
st
lucs
skirmishers
black
rifle
uttering
fierce
shouts
was
leading
a
strong
attack
in
the
center
the
firing
was
now
rapid
and
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
before
flashes
of
flame
appeared
everywhere
in
the
thicket
above
the
crackle
of
rifles
and
muskets
swelled
the
long
thrilling
war
cry
of
the
mohawks
and
back
in
fierce
defiance
came
the
yells
of
the
hurons
and
abenakis
willet
joined
robert
and
the
two
with
tayoga
saw
that
the
soldiers
fought
well
under
cover
the
young
philadelphians
in
the
excitement
of
battle
and
of
a
sudden
and
triumphant
reversal
of
fortune
were
likely
to
expose
themselves
rashly
and
the
advice
of
the
forest
veterans
was
timely
captain
colden
saw
that
it
was
taken
although
two
more
of
his
men
were
slain
as
they
advanced
and
several
were
wounded
but
the
issue
was
no
longer
doubtful
the
weight
that
the
mohawks
had
suddenly
thrown
into
the
battle
was
too
great
the
force
of
st
luc
was
steadily
driven
northward
and
daganowedas
alert
skirmishers
on
the
flanks
kept
it
compressed
together
robert
knew
how
bitter
the
defeat
would
be
to
st
luc
but
the
knowledge
did
not
keep
his
exultation
from
mounting
to
a
high
pitch
st
luc
might
strive
with
all
his
might
to
keep
his
men
in
the
battle
but
the
frenchmen
could
not
be
numerous
and
it
was
the
custom
of
indians
once
a
combat
seemed
lost
to
melt
away
like
a
mist
they
believed
thoroughly
that
it
was
best
to
run
away
and
fight
another
day
and
there
was
no
disgrace
in
escaping
from
a
stricken
field
they
run
they
run
and
the
frenchmen
must
run
with
them
exclaimed
black
rifle
as
he
spoke
a
bullet
grazed
his
side
and
struck
a
soldier
behind
him
but
the
force
pressed
on
with
the
ardor
fed
by
victory
willet
did
not
try
any
longer
to
restrain
them
although
he
understood
full
well
the
danger
of
a
battle
in
the
dark
but
he
knew
that
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
experienced
in
every
forest
wile
would
guard
them
against
surprise
and
he
deemed
it
best
now
that
they
should
strike
with
all
their
might
robert
seldom
saw
any
of
the
warriors
before
him
and
he
did
not
once
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
frenchman
whenever
his
rifle
was
loaded
he
fired
at
a
flitting
form
never
knowing
whether
or
not
his
bullet
struck
true
and
glad
of
his
ignorance
his
sensitive
and
imaginative
mind
became
greatly
excited
the
flashes
of
flame
in
the
thickets
were
multiplied
a
hundred
fold
a
thousand
little
pulses
beat
heavily
in
his
temples
and
the
shouts
of
the
savages
seemed
to
fill
the
forest
but
he
pressed
on
conscious
that
the
enemy
was
disappearing
before
them
in
his
eagerness
he
passed
ahead
of
willet
and
tayoga
and
came
very
near
to
st
lucs
retreating
line
his
foot
became
entangled
in
trailing
vines
and
he
fell
but
he
was
up
in
an
instant
and
he
fired
at
a
shadowy
figure
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
advance
in
his
haste
he
missed
and
the
figure
turning
raised
a
rifle
there
was
a
fair
moonlight
and
robert
saw
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
bearing
directly
upon
him
and
he
knew
too
that
the
rifle
was
held
by
firm
hands
his
vivid
and
sensitive
imagination
at
once
leaped
into
intense
life
his
own
weapon
was
empty
and
his
last
moment
had
come
he
saw
the
strong
brown
hands
holding
the
rifle
and
then
his
gaze
passed
on
to
the
face
of
st
luc
he
saw
the
blue
eyes
of
the
frenchman
as
they
looked
down
the
sights
open
wide
in
a
kind
of
horror
then
he
abruptly
dropped
the
muzzle
waved
one
hand
to
robert
and
vanished
in
the
thickets
and
the
darkness
the
battle
was
over
there
were
a
few
dying
shots
scattered
beads
of
flame
an
occasional
shout
of
triumph
from
the
mohawks
a
defiant
yell
or
two
in
reply
from
the
hurons
and
the
abenakis
and
then
the
trail
of
the
combat
swept
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
robert
who
stood
dazed
and
yet
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
st
luc
had
held
his
life
upon
the
pressure
of
a
trigger
and
the
trigger
would
have
been
pulled
had
he
not
seen
before
it
was
too
late
who
stood
before
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
the
moonlight
was
enough
for
robert
to
see
that
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
when
he
recognized
the
target
and
then
the
weapon
had
been
turned
away
and
he
had
gone
like
a
flash
why
for
what
reason
had
st
luc
spared
him
in
the
heat
and
fury
of
a
desperate
and
losing
battle
it
must
have
been
a
powerful
motive
for
a
man
to
stay
his
bullet
at
such
a
time
wake
up
lad
wake
up
the
battle
has
been
won
willets
heavy
but
friendly
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
and
robert
came
out
of
his
daze
he
decided
at
once
that
he
would
say
nothing
about
the
meeting
with
st
luc
and
merely
remarked
in
a
cryptic
manner
i
was
stunned
for
a
moment
by
a
bullet
that
did
not
hit
me
yes
weve
won
dave
thanks
to
the
mohawks
thanks
to
daganoweda
and
his
brave
mohawks
and
to
tayoga
and
to
the
gallant
captain
colden
and
his
gallant
men
all
of
us
together
have
made
the
triumph
possible
i
understand
that
the
bodies
of
only
two
frenchmen
have
been
found
and
that
neither
was
that
of
st
luc
well
im
glad
that
frenchman
will
do
us
great
damage
in
this
war
but
hes
an
honorable
foe
and
a
man
of
heart
and
i
like
him
a
man
of
heart
yes
truly
none
knew
it
better
than
robert
but
again
he
kept
his
own
counsel
he
too
was
glad
that
his
had
not
been
one
of
the
two
french
bodies
found
but
there
was
still
danger
from
the
pursuing
mohawks
who
would
hang
on
tenaciously
and
he
felt
a
sudden
thrill
of
alarm
but
it
passed
as
he
remembered
that
the
chevalier
was
a
woodsman
of
experience
and
surpassing
skill
tayoga
came
back
to
them
somewhat
blown
he
had
followed
the
fleeing
french
and
indian
force
two
or
three
miles
but
there
was
a
limit
even
to
his
nerves
and
sinews
of
wrought
steel
he
had
already
run
thirty
miles
before
joining
in
the
combat
and
now
it
was
time
to
rest
come
tayoga
said
the
hunter
well
go
back
to
the
ground
our
lads
have
defended
so
well
and
eat
drink
and
sleep
the
mohawks
will
attend
to
all
the
work
thats
left
which
isnt
much
weve
earned
our
repose
captain
colden
slightly
wounded
in
the
arm
appeared
and
willet
gave
him
the
high
compliments
that
he
and
his
soldiers
deserved
he
told
him
it
was
seldom
that
men
unused
to
the
woods
bore
themselves
so
well
in
an
indian
fight
but
the
young
captain
modestly
disclaimed
the
chief
merit
replying
that
he
and
his
detachment
would
surely
have
been
lost
had
it
not
been
for
willet
and
his
comrades
then
they
went
back
to
the
ground
near
the
cliff
where
they
had
made
their
great
fight
and
willet
although
the
night
was
warm
wisely
had
a
large
fire
built
he
knew
the
psychological
and
stimulating
effect
of
heat
and
light
upon
the
lads
of
the
city
who
had
passed
through
such
a
fearful
ordeal
in
the
dark
and
indianhaunted
forest
he
encouraged
them
to
throw
on
more
dead
boughs
until
the
blaze
leaped
higher
and
higher
and
sparkled
and
roared
sending
up
myriads
of
joyous
sparks
that
glowed
for
their
brief
lives
among
the
trees
and
then
died
no
fear
of
st
luc
and
the
indians
now
that
fierce
fringe
of
mohawks
was
a
barrier
that
they
could
never
pass
even
should
they
choose
to
return
and
no
such
choice
could
possibly
be
theirs
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
in
increasing
volume
and
the
philadelphia
lads
recovering
from
the
collapse
that
had
followed
tremendous
exertions
and
excitement
began
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
their
victory
and
to
talk
eagerly
with
one
another
but
the
period
of
full
rest
had
not
yet
come
captain
colden
made
them
dig
with
their
bayonets
shallow
graves
for
their
dead
six
in
number
fluent
of
speech
his
sensitive
mind
again
fitting
into
the
deep
gravity
of
the
situation
robert
said
a
few
words
above
them
words
that
he
felt
words
that
moved
those
who
heard
then
the
earth
was
thrown
in
and
stones
and
heavy
boughs
were
placed
over
all
to
keep
away
the
digging
wolves
or
other
wild
animals
the
wounded
were
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
before
the
fire
and
in
the
light
of
the
brilliant
flames
the
awe
created
by
the
dead
quickly
passed
food
was
served
and
fresh
water
was
drunk
the
canteens
being
refilled
from
a
spring
that
tayoga
found
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
the
soldiers
save
six
who
had
been
posted
as
guard
stretched
themselves
on
grass
or
leaves
and
fell
asleep
one
by
one
tayoga
who
had
made
the
greatest
physical
effort
followed
them
to
the
land
of
slumber
but
captain
colden
sat
and
talked
with
robert
and
willet
although
it
was
now
far
past
midnight
the
bushes
parted
and
a
dark
figure
making
no
sound
as
it
came
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
it
was
black
rifle
and
his
eyes
still
glittered
but
he
said
nothing
robert
thought
he
saw
upon
his
face
a
look
of
intense
satisfaction
and
once
more
he
shuddered
a
little
the
man
lay
down
with
his
rifle
beside
him
and
fell
asleep
his
hands
still
clutching
his
weapon
before
dawn
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
came
back
also
and
robert
in
behalf
of
them
all
thanked
the
young
chief
in
the
purest
mohawk
and
with
the
fine
phrasing
and
apt
allegory
so
dear
to
the
indian
heart
daganoweda
made
a
fitting
reply
saying
that
the
merit
did
not
belong
to
him
but
to
manitou
and
then
leaving
a
half
dozen
of
his
warriors
to
join
in
the
watch
he
and
the
others
slept
before
the
fire
it
was
well
that
you
played
so
strongly
upon
the
feelings
of
the
mohawks
at
that
test
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
robert
said
willet
if
you
had
not
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
quebec
of
the
french
was
once
the
stadacona
of
the
mohawks
they
would
not
have
been
here
tonight
to
save
us
they
say
that
deeds
speak
louder
than
words
but
when
the
same
man
speaks
with
both
words
and
deeds
people
have
got
to
hear
you
give
me
too
much
credit
dave
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
mohawk
attack
upon
the
french
aye
lad
but
one
had
to
see
a
chance
and
use
it
now
join
all
those
fellows
in
sleep
we
wont
move
before
noon
but
roberts
brain
was
too
active
for
sleep
just
yet
while
his
imaginative
power
made
him
see
things
before
other
people
saw
them
he
also
continued
to
see
them
after
they
were
gone
the
wilderness
battle
passed
once
more
before
him
and
when
he
brushed
his
eyes
to
thrust
it
away
he
looked
at
the
sleeping
mohawks
and
thought
what
splendid
savages
they
were
the
other
tribes
of
the
hodenosaunee
were
still
holding
to
their
neutralityall
that
was
asked
of
thembut
the
mohawks
with
the
memories
of
their
ancient
wrongs
burning
in
their
hearts
had
openly
taken
the
side
of
the
english
and
tonight
their
valor
and
skill
had
undoubtedly
saved
the
american
force
daganoweda
was
a
hero
and
so
was
tayoga
the
onondaga
always
the
first
of
red
men
to
robert
his
heated
brain
began
to
grow
cool
at
last
the
vivid
pictures
that
had
been
passing
so
fast
before
his
eyes
faded
he
saw
only
reality
the
blazing
fire
the
dusky
figures
lying
motionless
before
it
and
the
circling
wall
of
dark
woods
then
he
slept
willet
was
the
only
white
man
who
remained
awake
he
saw
the
great
fire
die
and
the
dawn
come
in
its
place
he
felt
then
for
the
first
time
in
all
that
long
encounter
the
strangeness
of
his
own
position
the
wilderness
savages
and
forest
battle
had
become
natural
to
him
and
yet
his
life
had
once
been
far
different
there
was
a
taste
of
a
distant
past
in
that
fierce
duel
at
quebec
when
he
slew
the
bravo
boucher
a
deed
for
which
he
had
never
felt
a
moments
regret
and
yet
when
he
balanced
the
old
times
against
the
present
he
could
not
say
which
had
the
advantage
he
had
found
true
friends
in
the
woods
men
who
would
and
did
risk
their
own
lives
to
save
his
the
dawn
came
swiftly
flooding
the
earth
with
light
daganoweda
and
many
of
the
mohawk
warriors
awoke
but
the
young
philadelphia
captain
and
his
men
slept
on
plunged
in
the
utter
stupor
of
exhaustion
tayoga
who
had
made
a
supreme
effort
both
physical
and
mental
also
continued
to
sleep
and
robert
lying
with
his
feet
to
the
coals
never
stirred
daganoweda
shook
himself
and
so
shaking
shook
the
last
shred
of
sleep
from
his
eyes
then
he
looked
with
pride
at
his
warriors
those
who
yet
lay
upon
the
ground
and
those
who
had
arisen
he
was
a
young
chief
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
and
he
was
the
bloom
and
flower
of
mohawk
courage
and
daring
his
name
daganoweda
the
inexhaustible
was
fully
deserved
as
his
bravery
and
resource
were
unlimited
but
unlike
tayoga
he
had
in
him
none
of
the
priestly
quality
he
had
not
drunk
or
even
sipped
at
the
white
mans
civilization
the
spirituality
so
often
to
be
found
in
the
onondagas
was
unknown
to
him
he
was
a
warrior
first
last
and
all
the
time
he
was
daganoweda
of
the
clan
of
the
turtle
of
the
nation
ganeagaono
the
keepers
of
the
eastern
gate
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
he
craved
no
glory
save
that
to
be
won
in
battle
which
he
craved
all
the
time
daganoweda
as
he
looked
at
his
men
felt
intense
satisfaction
because
the
achievement
of
his
mohawks
the
night
before
had
been
brilliant
and
successful
but
he
concealed
it
from
all
save
himself
it
was
not
for
a
chief
who
wished
to
win
not
one
victory
but
a
hundred
to
show
undue
elation
but
he
turned
and
for
a
few
moments
gazed
directly
into
the
sun
with
unwinking
eyes
and
when
he
shifted
his
gaze
away
a
great
tide
of
life
leaped
in
his
veins
then
he
gave
silent
thanks
like
all
the
other
indians
in
north
america
the
mohawks
personified
and
worshipped
the
sun
which
to
them
was
the
mighty
dweller
in
heaven
almost
the
same
as
manitou
a
great
spirit
to
whom
sacrifices
and
thanksgivings
were
to
be
made
the
sun
an
immortal
being
had
risen
that
morning
and
from
his
seat
in
the
highest
of
the
high
heavens
he
had
looked
down
with
his
invincible
eye
which
no
man
could
face
more
than
a
few
seconds
upon
his
favorite
children
the
mohawks
to
whom
he
had
given
the
victory
daganoweda
bowed
a
head
naturally
haughty
and
under
his
breath
murmured
thanks
for
the
triumph
given
and
prayers
for
others
to
come
the
warriors
built
the
fire
anew
and
cooked
their
breakfasts
they
had
venison
and
hominy
of
three
kinds
according
to
the
corn
of
which
it
was
made
onaogaant
or
the
white
corn
ticne
or
the
red
corn
and
hagowa
or
the
white
flint
corn
they
also
had
bear
meat
and
dried
beans
so
their
breakfast
was
abundant
and
they
ate
with
the
appetite
of
warriors
who
had
done
mighty
deeds
daganoweda
and
willet
as
became
great
men
sat
together
on
a
log
and
were
served
by
a
warrior
who
took
honor
from
the
task
black
rifle
sat
alone
a
little
distance
away
he
would
have
been
welcome
in
the
company
of
the
mohawk
chief
and
the
hunter
but
brooding
and
solitary
in
mind
he
wished
to
be
alone
and
they
knew
and
respected
his
wish
daganoweda
glanced
at
him
more
than
once
as
he
remained
in
silence
and
always
there
was
pity
in
his
looks
and
there
was
admiration
too
because
black
rifle
was
a
great
warrior
the
woods
held
none
greater
when
robert
awoke
it
was
well
on
toward
noon
and
he
sprang
up
refreshed
and
strong
youve
had
quite
a
nap
robert
said
willet
who
had
not
slept
at
all
but
some
of
the
soldiers
are
still
sleeping
and
tayoga
has
just
gone
down
to
the
spring
to
bathe
his
face
which
i
also
will
do
said
robert
and
when
you
come
back
food
will
be
ready
for
you
robert
found
tayoga
at
the
spring
flexing
his
muscles
and
taking
short
steps
back
and
forth
it
was
a
great
run
you
made
said
the
white
youth
and
it
saved
us
theres
no
stiffness
i
hope
there
was
a
little
dagaeoga
but
i
have
worked
it
out
of
my
body
now
all
my
muscles
are
as
they
were
i
am
ready
to
make
another
and
equal
run
its
not
needed
and
for
that
im
thankful
st
luc
will
not
come
back
nor
will
tandakora
i
think
linger
in
the
woods
hoping
for
a
shot
he
knows
that
the
mohawk
skirmishers
will
be
too
vigilant
as
they
went
back
to
the
fire
for
their
food
they
heard
a
droning
song
and
the
regular
beat
of
feet
some
of
the
mohawks
were
dancing
the
buffalo
dance
a
dance
named
after
an
animal
never
found
in
their
country
but
which
they
knew
well
it
was
a
tribute
to
the
vast
energy
and
daring
of
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
that
they
should
range
in
such
remote
regions
as
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
hunt
the
buffalo
with
the
cherokees
who
came
up
from
the
south
they
called
the
dance
dageyagooanno
and
it
was
always
danced
by
men
only
one
warrior
beat
upon
the
drum
ganojoo
and
another
used
gusdawasa
or
the
rattle
made
of
the
shell
of
a
squash
a
dozen
warriors
danced
and
players
and
dancers
alike
sang
it
was
a
most
singular
dance
and
robert
as
he
ate
and
drank
watched
it
with
curious
interest
the
warriors
capered
back
and
forth
and
often
they
bent
themselves
far
over
until
their
hands
touched
the
ground
then
they
would
arch
their
backs
until
they
formed
a
kind
of
hump
and
they
leaped
to
and
fro
bellowing
all
the
time
the
imitation
was
that
of
a
buffalo
recognizable
at
once
and
while
it
was
rude
and
monotonous
both
dancing
and
singing
preserved
a
rhythm
and
as
one
listened
continuously
it
soon
crept
into
the
blood
robert
with
that
singular
temperament
of
his
so
receptive
to
all
impressions
began
to
feel
it
their
chant
was
of
war
and
victory
and
he
stirred
to
both
he
was
on
the
warpath
with
them
and
he
passed
with
them
through
the
thick
of
battle
they
danced
for
a
long
time
quitting
only
when
exhaustion
compelled
by
that
time
all
the
soldiers
were
awake
and
captain
colden
talked
with
the
other
leaders
red
and
white
his
instructions
took
him
farther
west
where
he
was
to
build
a
fort
for
the
defense
of
the
border
and
staunch
and
true
he
did
not
mean
to
turn
back
because
he
had
been
in
desperate
battle
with
the
french
and
their
indian
allies
i
was
sent
to
protect
a
section
of
the
frontier
he
said
to
willet
and
while
ive
found
it
hard
to
protect
my
men
and
myself
yet
i
must
go
on
i
could
never
return
to
philadelphia
and
face
our
people
there
its
a
just
view
you
take
captain
colden
said
willet
i
feel
though
that
my
men
and
i
are
but
children
in
the
woods
yesterday
and
last
night
proved
it
if
you
and
your
friends
continue
with
us
our
march
may
not
be
in
vain
willet
glanced
at
robert
and
then
at
tayoga
ours
for
the
present
at
least
is
a
roving
commission
said
young
lennox
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
go
with
captain
colden
i
am
not
called
back
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
said
tayoga
i
would
see
the
building
of
this
fort
that
captain
colden
has
planned
then
we
three
are
agreed
said
the
hunter
its
best
not
to
speak
to
black
rifle
because
hell
follow
his
own
notions
anyway
and
as
for
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
i
think
theyre
likely
to
resume
their
march
northward
against
the
french
border
im
grateful
to
you
three
said
captain
colden
and
now
that
its
settled
well
start
as
soon
as
we
can
better
give
them
all
a
good
rest
and
wait
until
the
morning
said
the
hunter
again
captain
colden
agreed
with
him
chapter
iv
the
perilous
path
after
a
long
night
of
sleep
and
rest
the
little
troop
resumed
its
march
the
next
morning
the
wounded
fortunately
were
not
hurt
so
badly
that
they
could
not
limp
along
with
the
others
and
while
the
surgery
of
the
soldiers
was
rude
it
was
effective
nevertheless
daganoweda
as
they
had
expected
prepared
to
leave
them
for
a
raid
toward
the
st
lawrence
but
he
said
rather
grimly
that
he
might
return
in
a
month
perhaps
he
knew
where
they
were
going
to
build
their
fort
and
unless
corlear
and
all
the
other
british
governors
awoke
much
earlier
in
the
morning
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
young
captain
from
philadelphia
would
need
the
help
of
the
mohawks
again
then
daganoweda
said
farewell
to
robert
tayoga
willet
and
black
rifle
addressing
each
according
to
his
quality
them
he
trusted
he
knew
them
to
be
great
warriors
and
daring
rovers
of
the
wilderness
he
had
no
advice
for
them
because
he
knew
they
did
not
need
it
but
he
expected
them
to
be
his
comrades
often
in
the
great
war
and
he
wished
them
well
to
tayoga
he
said
you
and
i
oh
young
chief
of
the
onondagas
have
hearts
that
beat
alike
the
onondagas
do
well
to
keep
aloof
from
the
white
mans
quarrels
for
the
present
and
to
sit
at
peace
though
watchful
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
your
hopes
are
with
our
friends
the
english
and
you
in
person
fight
for
them
we
mohawks
know
whom
to
hate
we
know
that
the
french
have
robbed
us
more
than
any
others
we
know
that
their
quebec
is
our
stadacona
so
we
have
dug
up
the
tomahawk
and
last
night
we
showed
to
sharp
sword
and
his
men
and
tandakora
the
ojibway
how
we
could
use
it
sharp
sword
was
the
iroquois
name
for
st
luc
who
had
already
proved
his
great
ability
and
daring
as
a
forest
leader
the
ganeagaono
are
now
the
chief
barrier
against
the
french
and
their
tribes
said
tayoga
the
brilliant
eyes
of
daganoweda
glittered
in
his
dark
face
he
knew
that
tayoga
would
not
pay
the
mohawks
so
high
a
compliment
unless
he
meant
it
tayoga
he
said
we
belong
to
the
leading
nations
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
you
to
the
onundahgaono
and
i
to
the
ganeagaono
you
are
first
in
the
council
and
we
are
first
on
the
warpath
it
was
tododaho
the
onondaga
who
first
formed
the
great
league
and
it
was
hayowentha
the
mohawk
who
combed
the
snakes
out
of
his
hair
and
who
strengthened
it
and
who
helped
him
to
build
it
so
firmly
that
it
shall
last
forever
brothers
are
we
and
always
shall
be
he
touched
his
forehead
in
salute
and
the
onondaga
touched
his
in
reply
aye
brothers
are
we
he
said
mohawk
and
onondaga
onondaga
and
mohawk
the
great
war
of
the
white
kings
which
draws
us
in
it
has
come
but
i
know
that
hayowentha
watches
over
his
people
and
tododaho
over
his
in
the
spring
when
i
went
forth
in
the
night
to
fight
the
hurons
i
gazed
off
there
in
the
west
where
shines
the
great
star
on
which
tododaho
makes
his
home
and
i
saw
him
looking
down
upon
me
and
casting
about
me
the
veil
of
his
protection
daganoweda
looked
up
at
the
gleaming
blue
of
the
heavens
and
his
eyes
glittered
again
he
believed
every
word
that
tayoga
said
as
tododaho
watches
over
you
so
hayowentha
watches
over
me
he
said
and
he
will
bring
me
back
in
safety
and
victory
from
the
st
lawrence
farewell
again
my
brother
farewell
once
more
daganoweda
the
mohawk
chief
plunged
into
the
forest
and
his
fifty
warriors
followed
him
like
a
shadow
they
were
gone
and
the
waving
bushes
gave
back
no
sign
that
they
had
ever
been
captain
colden
rubbed
his
eyes
and
then
laughed
i
never
knew
men
to
vanish
so
swiftly
before
he
said
but
last
night
was
good
proof
that
they
were
here
and
that
they
came
in
time
i
suppose
its
about
the
only
victory
of
which
we
can
make
boast
he
spoke
the
full
truth
from
the
st
lawrence
to
the
ohio
the
border
was
already
ravaged
with
fire
and
sword
appeals
for
help
were
pouring
in
from
the
distant
settlements
and
the
governors
of
new
york
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
france
had
struck
the
first
blow
and
she
had
struck
hard
young
washington
defeated
by
overwhelming
numbers
was
going
back
to
virginia
and
duquesne
the
fort
of
the
french
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
and
allegheny
was
a
powerful
rallying
place
for
their
own
forces
and
the
swarming
indian
bands
pouring
out
of
the
wilderness
drawn
by
the
tales
of
unlimited
scalps
and
plunder
the
task
before
captain
coldens
slender
force
was
full
of
danger
his
numbers
might
have
been
five
times
as
great
and
then
they
would
not
have
been
too
many
to
build
and
hold
the
fort
he
was
sent
to
build
and
hold
but
he
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
and
as
soon
as
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
were
gone
they
started
bending
their
course
somewhat
farther
toward
the
south
at
the
ford
of
a
river
twenty
men
with
horses
carrying
food
ammunition
and
other
supplies
were
to
meet
them
and
they
reckoned
that
they
could
reach
it
by
midnight
the
men
with
the
horses
had
been
sent
from
another
point
and
it
was
not
thought
then
that
there
was
any
danger
of
french
and
indian
attack
before
the
junction
was
made
but
the
colonial
authorities
had
reckoned
without
the
vigor
and
daring
of
st
luc
now
the
most
cruel
fears
assailed
young
captain
colden
and
robert
and
the
hunter
could
not
find
much
argument
to
remove
them
it
was
possible
that
the
second
force
had
been
ambushed
also
and
if
so
it
had
certainly
been
destroyed
being
capable
of
no
such
resistance
as
that
made
by
coldens
men
and
without
the
aid
of
the
three
friends
and
the
mohawks
and
if
the
supplies
were
gone
the
expedition
would
be
useless
dont
be
downhearted
about
it
captain
said
willet
you
say
theres
not
a
man
in
the
party
who
knows
anything
about
the
wilderness
and
that
theyve
got
just
enough
woods
sense
to
take
them
to
the
ford
well
that
has
its
saving
grace
because
now
and
then
the
lord
seems
to
watch
over
fool
men
the
best
of
hunters
are
trapped
sometimes
in
the
forest
when
fellows
who
dont
know
a
deer
from
a
beaver
go
through
em
without
harm
then
if
theres
any
virtue
in
what
you
say
well
pray
that
these
men
are
the
biggest
fools
who
ever
lived
smoke
smoke
again
called
robert
cheerily
pointing
straight
ahead
sure
enough
that
long
dark
thread
appeared
once
more
now
against
the
western
sky
willet
laughed
theyre
the
biggest
fools
in
the
forest
just
as
you
hoped
captain
he
said
and
theyve
taken
no
more
harm
than
if
they
had
built
their
fires
in
a
philadelphia
street
theyve
set
themselves
down
for
the
night
as
peaceful
and
happy
as
you
please
if
that
isnt
the
campfire
of
your
men
with
the
pack
horses
then
ill
eat
my
cap
captain
colden
laughed
but
it
was
the
slightly
hysterical
laugh
of
relief
he
was
bent
upon
doing
his
task
and
since
the
lord
had
carried
him
so
far
through
a
mighty
danger
the
disappointment
of
losing
the
supplies
would
have
been
almost
too
much
to
bear
youre
sure
its
they
mr
willet
he
said
of
course
didnt
i
tell
you
it
wasnt
possible
for
another
such
party
of
fools
to
be
here
in
the
wilderness
and
that
the
god
of
the
white
man
and
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
taking
pity
on
their
simplicity
and
innocence
have
protected
them
i
like
to
think
what
you
say
is
true
mr
willet
its
true
be
not
afraid
that
it
isnt
now
i
think
wed
better
stop
here
and
let
robert
and
tayoga
go
ahead
spy
em
out
and
make
signals
it
would
be
just
like
em
to
blaze
away
at
us
the
moment
they
saw
the
bushes
move
with
our
coming
captain
colden
was
glad
to
take
his
advice
and
the
white
youth
and
the
red
went
forward
silently
through
the
forest
hearing
the
sound
of
cheerful
voices
as
they
drew
near
to
the
campfire
which
was
a
large
one
blazing
brightly
they
also
heard
the
sound
of
horses
moving
and
they
knew
that
the
detachment
had
taken
no
harm
tayoga
parted
the
bushes
and
peered
forth
look
he
said
surely
they
are
watched
over
by
manitou
about
twenty
men
or
rather
boys
for
all
of
them
were
very
young
were
standing
or
lying
about
a
fire
a
tall
very
ruddy
youth
in
the
uniform
of
a
colonial
lieutenant
was
speaking
to
them
didnt
i
tell
you
lads
he
said
there
wasnt
an
indian
nearer
than
fort
duquesne
and
thats
a
long
way
from
here
weve
come
a
great
distance
and
not
a
foe
has
appeared
anywhere
it
may
be
that
the
french
vanish
when
they
hear
this
valiant
quaker
troop
is
coming
but
its
my
own
personal
opinion
theyll
stay
pretty
well
back
in
the
west
with
their
red
allies
the
youth
although
he
called
himself
so
did
not
look
much
like
a
quaker
to
robert
he
had
a
frank
face
and
merry
eyes
and
manner
and
voice
indicated
a
tendency
to
gayety
judging
from
his
words
he
had
no
cares
and
indians
and
ambush
were
far
from
his
thoughts
proof
of
this
was
the
absence
of
sentinels
the
men
scattered
about
the
fire
were
eating
their
suppers
and
the
horses
forty
in
number
were
grazing
in
an
open
space
it
all
looked
like
a
great
picnic
and
the
effect
was
heightened
by
the
youth
of
the
soldiers
as
the
great
bear
truly
said
whispered
tayoga
manitou
has
watched
over
them
the
forest
does
not
hold
easier
game
for
the
taking
and
had
tandakora
known
that
they
were
here
he
would
have
come
seeking
revenge
for
his
loss
in
the
attack
upon
captain
coldens
troop
youre
right
as
usual
tayoga
and
now
wed
better
hail
them
but
dont
you
come
forward
just
yet
they
dont
know
the
difference
between
indians
and
likely
your
welcome
would
be
a
bullet
i
will
wait
said
tayoga
i
tell
you
carson
the
young
lieutenant
was
saying
in
an
oratorical
manner
that
they
magnify
the
dangers
of
the
wilderness
the
ford
at
which
we
were
to
meet
colden
is
just
ahead
and
weve
come
straight
to
it
without
the
slightest
mishap
colden
is
no
sluggard
and
he
should
be
here
in
the
morning
at
the
latest
do
you
find
anything
wrong
with
my
reasoning
hugh
naught
william
replied
the
other
who
seemed
to
be
second
in
command
your
logic
is
both
precise
and
beautiful
the
dangers
of
the
border
are
greatly
exaggerated
and
as
soon
as
we
get
together
a
good
force
all
these
french
and
indians
will
flee
back
to
canada
ah
who
is
this
both
he
and
his
chief
turned
and
faced
the
woods
in
astonishment
a
youth
had
stepped
forth
and
stood
in
full
view
he
was
taller
than
either
but
younger
dressed
completely
in
deerskin
although
superior
in
cut
and
quality
to
that
of
the
ordinary
borderer
his
complexion
fair
beneath
his
tan
and
his
hair
light
he
gazed
at
them
steadily
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
both
the
first
lieutenant
and
the
second
lieutenant
of
the
quaker
troop
saw
that
he
was
no
common
person
who
are
you
repeated
william
wilton
who
was
the
first
lieutenant
who
are
you
repeated
hugh
carson
who
was
the
second
lieutenant
my
name
is
robert
lennox
replied
the
young
stranger
in
a
mellow
voice
of
amazing
quality
and
you
i
suppose
are
lieutenant
william
wilton
the
commander
of
this
little
troop
he
spoke
directly
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
replied
impressed
as
much
by
the
youths
voice
as
he
was
by
his
appearance
yes
such
is
my
name
but
how
did
you
know
it
i
dont
recall
ever
having
met
you
before
which
doubtless
is
my
loss
i
heard
it
from
an
associate
of
yours
your
chief
in
command
captain
james
colden
and
i
am
here
with
a
message
from
him
and
so
colden
is
coming
up
well
we
beat
him
to
the
place
of
meeting
weve
triumphed
with
ease
over
the
hardships
of
the
wilderness
yes
you
arrived
first
but
he
was
delayed
by
a
matter
of
importance
a
problem
that
had
to
be
solved
before
he
could
resume
his
march
you
speak
in
riddles
sir
perhaps
i
do
for
the
present
but
i
shall
soon
make
full
explanations
i
wish
to
call
first
a
friend
of
mine
an
indianalthough
you
say
there
are
no
indians
in
the
foresta
most
excellent
friend
of
ours
tayoga
come
the
onondaga
appeared
silently
in
the
circle
of
light
a
splendid
primeval
figure
drawn
to
the
uttermost
of
his
great
height
his
lofty
gaze
meeting
that
of
wilton
half
in
challenge
and
half
in
greeting
robert
had
been
an
impressive
figure
but
tayoga
owing
to
the
difference
in
race
was
even
more
so
the
hands
of
several
of
the
soldiers
moved
towards
their
weapons
did
i
not
tell
you
that
he
was
a
friend
a
most
excellent
friend
of
ours
said
robert
sharply
who
raises
a
hand
against
him
raises
a
hand
against
me
also
and
above
all
raises
a
hand
against
our
cause
lieutenant
wilton
this
is
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
is
a
prince
as
much
a
prince
as
any
in
europe
his
mind
and
his
valor
have
both
been
expended
freely
in
our
service
and
they
will
be
expended
with
equal
freedom
again
roberts
tone
was
so
sharp
and
commanding
that
wilton
impressed
by
it
saluted
the
onondaga
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
tayoga
bowed
gravely
in
reply
youre
correct
in
assuming
that
my
name
is
wilton
said
the
young
lieutenant
im
william
wilton
of
philadelphia
and
i
beg
to
present
my
second
in
command
hugh
carson
of
the
same
city
he
looked
questioningly
at
robert
who
promptly
responded
my
name
is
lennox
robert
lennox
and
i
can
claim
either
albany
or
new
york
as
a
home
i
think
ive
heard
of
you
said
wilton
a
rumor
came
to
philadelphia
about
a
man
of
that
name
going
to
quebec
on
an
errand
for
the
governor
of
new
york
i
was
the
messenger
said
robert
but
since
the
mission
was
a
failure
it
may
as
well
be
forgotten
but
it
will
not
be
forgotten
ive
heard
that
you
bore
yourself
with
great
judgment
and
address
nevertheless
if
your
modesty
forbids
the
subject
well
come
back
to
another
more
pressing
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
captain
coldens
delay
was
due
to
the
solution
of
a
vexing
problem
it
had
to
do
with
indians
who
you
say
are
not
to
be
found
in
these
forests
i
could
not
help
overhearing
you
as
i
approached
your
camp
wilton
reddened
and
then
his
generous
impulse
and
sense
of
truth
came
to
his
aid
ill
admit
that
im
careless
and
that
my
knowledge
may
be
small
he
exclaimed
but
tell
me
the
facts
mr
lennox
i
judge
by
your
face
that
events
of
grave
importance
have
occurred
captain
colden
far
east
of
this
point
was
attacked
by
a
strong
force
of
french
and
indians
under
the
renowned
partisan
leader
st
luc
tayoga
david
willet
the
hunter
the
famous
ranger
black
rifle
and
i
were
able
to
warn
him
and
give
him
some
help
but
even
then
we
should
have
been
overborne
and
destroyed
had
not
a
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
and
a
formidable
band
come
to
our
aid
united
we
defeated
st
luc
and
drove
him
northward
captain
colden
lost
several
of
his
men
but
with
the
rest
he
is
now
marching
to
the
junction
with
you
wiltons
face
turned
gray
but
in
a
moment
or
two
his
eyes
brightened
then
a
special
providence
has
been
watching
over
us
he
said
we
havent
seen
or
heard
of
an
indian
his
tone
was
one
of
mingled
relief
and
humor
and
robert
could
not
keep
from
laughing
at
all
events
he
said
you
are
safe
for
the
present
ill
remain
with
you
while
tayoga
goes
back
for
captain
colden
if
youll
be
so
good
said
wilton
who
did
not
forget
his
manners
despite
the
circumstances
ive
begun
to
feel
that
we
have
more
eyes
or
at
least
better
ones
with
you
among
us
where
is
that
indian
you
dont
mean
to
say
hes
gone
robert
laughed
again
tayoga
after
his
fashion
had
vanished
in
silence
hes
well
on
his
way
to
captain
colden
now
he
said
exaggerating
a
little
for
the
sake
of
effect
hell
be
a
great
chief
some
day
and
meanwhile
hes
the
fastest
runner
in
the
whole
six
nations
colden
and
his
troop
arrived
soon
and
the
two
little
commands
were
united
to
the
great
joy
of
all
lieutenant
wilton
had
passed
from
the
extreme
of
confidence
to
the
utmost
distrust
where
it
had
not
been
possible
for
an
indian
to
exist
he
now
saw
a
scalplock
in
every
bush
on
my
honor
he
said
to
colden
james
i
was
never
before
in
my
life
so
happy
to
see
you
im
glad
you
have
the
entire
command
now
as
mr
lennox
said
providence
saved
me
so
far
but
perhaps
it
wouldnt
lend
a
helping
hand
any
longer
the
pack
horses
carried
surgical
supplies
for
the
wounded
and
willet
and
black
rifle
were
skillful
in
using
them
all
of
the
hurt
they
were
sure
would
be
well
again
within
a
week
and
there
was
little
to
mar
the
general
feeling
of
high
spirits
that
prevailed
in
the
camp
wilton
and
carson
were
lads
of
mettle
full
of
talk
of
philadelphia
then
the
greatest
city
in
the
british
colonies
and
related
to
most
of
its
leading
families
as
was
colden
too
his
family
being
a
branch
of
the
new
york
family
of
that
name
robert
was
at
home
with
them
at
once
and
they
were
eager
to
hear
from
him
about
quebec
and
the
latest
fashions
of
the
french
already
the
arbiters
of
fashion
and
recognized
as
such
despite
the
war
between
them
by
english
and
americans
i
had
hoped
to
go
to
quebec
myself
said
wilton
reflectively
but
i
suppose
its
a
visit
thats
delayed
for
a
long
time
now
how
does
it
happen
that
you
a
quaker
are
second
in
command
here
asked
robert
it
must
be
the
belligerency
repressed
through
three
or
four
generations
and
breaking
out
at
last
in
me
replied
wilton
his
eyes
twinkling
i
suppose
theres
just
so
much
fighting
in
every
family
and
if
three
or
four
generations
in
succession
are
peaceful
the
next
that
follows
is
likely
to
be
full
of
warlike
fury
so
as
soon
as
the
war
began
i
started
for
it
its
not
inherent
in
me
as
i
said
its
the
confined
ardor
of
generations
bursting
forth
suddenly
in
my
person
im
not
an
active
agent
im
merely
an
instrument
it
was
the
same
warlike
fury
that
caused
you
to
come
here
build
your
fire
and
set
no
watch
expecting
the
woods
to
be
as
peaceful
as
philadelphia
said
colden
wilton
colored
i
didnt
dream
the
french
and
indians
were
so
near
he
replied
apologetically
if
comparisons
are
valuable
you
neednt
feel
any
mortification
about
it
will
said
colden
i
was
just
about
as
careless
myself
and
all
of
us
would
have
lost
our
scalps
if
willet
lennox
and
tayoga
hadnt
come
along
wilton
was
consoled
but
both
he
and
colden
after
the
severe
lesson
the
latter
had
received
were
now
all
for
vigilance
many
sentinels
had
been
posted
and
since
colden
was
glad
to
follow
the
advice
of
willet
and
tayoga
they
were
put
in
the
best
places
they
let
the
fire
die
early
as
the
weather
had
now
become
very
warm
and
all
of
them
save
the
watch
soon
slept
the
night
brought
little
coolness
with
it
and
the
wind
that
blew
was
warm
and
drying
under
its
touch
the
leaves
began
to
crinkle
up
at
the
edge
and
turn
brown
the
grass
showed
signs
of
withering
and
willet
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
guard
that
night
noticed
that
summer
was
passing
into
the
brown
leaf
it
caused
him
a
pang
of
disappointment
great
britain
and
the
colonies
had
not
yet
begun
to
move
the
provincial
legislatures
still
wrangled
and
the
government
at
london
was
provokingly
slow
there
was
still
no
plan
of
campaign
the
great
resources
of
the
anglosaxons
had
not
yet
been
brought
together
for
use
against
the
quick
and
daring
french
and
while
their
slow
patient
courage
might
win
in
the
end
willet
foresaw
a
long
and
terrible
war
with
many
disasters
at
the
beginning
he
was
depressed
for
the
moment
he
knew
what
an
impression
the
early
french
successes
would
make
on
the
indian
tribes
and
he
knew
too
as
he
heard
the
wind
rustling
through
the
dry
leaves
that
there
would
be
no
english
campaign
that
year
one
might
lead
an
army
in
winter
on
the
good
roads
and
through
the
open
fields
of
europe
but
then
only
borderers
could
make
way
through
the
vast
north
american
wilderness
in
the
deep
snows
and
bitter
cold
where
indian
trails
alone
existed
the
hunter
foresaw
a
long
delay
before
the
british
and
colonial
forces
moved
and
meanwhile
the
french
and
indians
would
be
more
strongly
planted
in
the
territory
claimed
by
the
rival
nations
and
while
in
law
possession
was
often
nine
points
it
seemed
in
war
to
be
ten
points
and
all
as
he
walked
back
and
forth
black
rifle
touched
him
on
the
arm
im
going
dave
he
said
they
dont
need
me
here
any
longer
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
likely
enough
will
follow
the
french
and
indians
and
have
another
brush
with
em
at
any
rate
its
sure
that
st
luc
and
tandakora
wont
come
back
and
these
young
men
can
go
on
without
being
attacked
again
and
build
their
fort
but
theyll
be
threatened
there
later
on
and
ill
come
again
with
a
warning
i
know
you
will
said
willet
wherever
danger
appears
on
the
border
black
rifle
there
you
are
i
see
great
and
terrible
days
ahead
for
us
all
and
so
do
i
said
black
rifle
this
continent
is
on
fire
the
two
shook
hands
and
the
somber
figure
of
black
rifle
disappeared
in
the
forest
willet
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
and
then
resumed
his
pacing
to
and
fro
they
made
an
early
start
at
dawn
of
a
bright
hot
day
crossed
the
ford
and
resumed
their
long
march
through
the
forest
which
under
the
light
wind
now
rustled
continually
with
the
increasing
dryness
but
the
company
was
joyous
the
wounded
were
put
upon
the
pack
horses
and
the
others
young
strong
and
refreshed
by
abundant
rest
went
forward
with
springing
steps
robert
and
tayoga
walked
with
the
three
philadelphians
colden
already
knew
the
quality
of
the
onondaga
and
respected
and
admired
him
and
wilton
and
carson
surprised
at
first
at
his
excellent
english
education
soon
saw
that
he
was
no
ordinary
youth
the
five
each
a
type
of
his
own
were
fast
friends
before
the
days
march
was
over
wilton
the
quaker
was
the
greatest
talker
of
them
all
which
he
declared
was
due
to
suppression
in
childhood
its
something
like
the
battle
fever
which
will
come
out
along
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
generation
he
said
i
suppose
theres
a
certain
amount
of
talk
that
every
man
must
do
in
his
lifetime
and
having
been
kept
in
a
state
of
silence
by
my
parents
all
through
my
youth
im
now
letting
myself
loose
in
the
woods
dont
apologize
will
said
colden
your
chatter
is
harmless
and
it
lightens
the
spirits
of
us
all
the
talker
has
his
uses
said
tayoga
gravely
my
friend
lennox
known
to
the
hodenosaunee
as
dagaeoga
is
goldenmouthed
the
gift
of
great
speech
descends
upon
him
when
time
and
place
are
fitting
and
so
youre
an
orator
are
you
said
carson
looking
at
robert
young
lennox
blushed
tayoga
is
my
very
good
friend
he
replied
and
he
gives
me
praise
i
dont
deserve
when
one
has
a
gift
direct
from
manitou
said
the
onondaga
gravely
it
is
not
well
to
deny
it
it
is
a
sign
of
great
favor
and
you
must
not
show
ingratitude
dagaeoga
he
has
you
lennox
laughed
wilton
but
you
neednt
say
more
i
know
that
tayoga
is
right
and
im
waiting
to
hear
you
talk
in
a
crisis
robert
blushed
once
more
but
was
silent
he
knew
that
if
he
protested
again
the
young
philadelphians
would
chaff
him
without
mercy
and
he
knew
at
heart
also
that
tayogas
statement
about
him
was
true
he
remembered
with
pride
his
defeat
of
st
luc
in
the
great
test
of
words
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
wiltons
mind
quickly
turned
to
another
subject
he
seemed
to
exemplify
the
truth
of
his
own
declaration
that
all
the
impulses
bottled
up
in
four
or
five
generations
of
quaker
ancestors
were
at
last
bursting
out
in
him
he
talked
more
than
all
the
others
combined
and
he
rejoiced
in
the
freedom
of
the
wilderness
im
a
spirit
released
he
said
thats
why
i
chatter
so
perhaps
its
just
as
well
will
that
while
you
have
the
chance
you
should
chatter
to
your
hearts
content
because
at
any
time
an
indian
arrow
may
cut
short
your
chance
for
chattering
said
carson
i
cant
believe
it
hugh
said
wilton
because
if
providence
was
willing
to
preserve
us
when
we
camped
squarely
among
the
indians
put
out
no
guards
and
fairly
asked
them
to
come
and
shoot
at
us
then
it
was
for
a
purpose
and
well
be
preserved
through
greater
and
continuous
dangers
there
may
be
something
in
it
will
i
notice
that
those
who
deserve
it
least
are
often
the
chosen
favorites
of
fortune
which
seems
to
be
a
hit
at
your
superior
officer
but
ill
pass
it
over
hugh
as
youre
always
right
at
heart
though
often
wrong
in
the
head
although
the
young
officers
talked
much
and
with
apparent
lightness
the
troop
marched
with
vigilance
now
willet
and
tayoga
and
colden
who
had
profited
by
bitter
experience
saw
to
it
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
often
assisted
by
robert
scouted
on
the
flanks
and
three
or
four
soldiers
who
developed
rapid
skill
in
the
woods
were
soon
able
to
help
but
tayoga
and
willet
were
the
main
reliance
and
they
found
no
further
trace
of
indians
nevertheless
the
guard
was
never
relaxed
for
an
instant
robert
found
the
march
not
only
pleasant
but
exhilarating
it
appealed
to
his
imaginative
and
sensitive
mind
which
magnified
everything
and
made
the
tints
more
vivid
and
brilliant
to
him
the
forests
were
larger
and
grander
than
they
were
to
the
others
and
the
rivers
were
wider
and
deeper
the
hours
were
more
intense
he
lived
every
second
of
them
and
the
future
had
a
scope
and
brilliancy
that
few
others
would
foresee
in
company
with
youths
of
his
own
age
coming
from
the
largest
city
of
the
british
colonies
the
one
that
had
the
richest
social
traditions
his
whole
nature
expanded
and
he
cast
away
much
of
his
reserve
around
the
campfires
in
the
evening
he
became
one
of
the
most
industrious
talkers
and
now
and
then
he
was
carried
away
so
much
by
his
own
impulse
that
all
the
rest
would
cease
and
listen
to
the
mellow
golden
voice
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
then
tayoga
and
willet
would
look
at
each
other
and
smile
knowing
that
dagaeoga
though
all
unconsciously
held
the
center
of
the
stage
and
the
others
were
more
than
willing
for
him
to
hold
it
the
friendships
of
the
young
ripen
fast
and
under
such
circumstances
they
ripen
faster
than
ever
robert
soon
felt
that
he
had
known
the
three
young
philadelphians
for
years
and
a
warm
friendship
destined
to
last
all
their
lives
in
which
tayoga
was
included
was
soon
formed
robert
saw
that
his
new
comrades
although
they
did
not
know
much
of
the
forest
were
intelligent
staunch
and
brave
and
they
saw
in
him
all
that
tayoga
and
willet
saw
which
was
a
great
deal
the
heat
and
dryness
increased
and
the
brown
of
leaf
and
grass
deepened
nearly
all
the
green
was
gone
now
and
autumn
would
soon
come
the
forest
was
full
of
game
and
willet
and
tayoga
kept
them
well
supplied
yet
their
progress
became
slower
those
who
had
been
wounded
severely
approached
the
critical
stage
and
once
they
stopped
two
days
until
all
danger
had
passed
three
days
later
a
fierce
summer
storm
burst
upon
them
tayoga
had
foreseen
it
and
the
whole
troop
was
gathered
in
the
lee
of
a
hill
with
all
their
ammunition
protected
by
blankets
canvas
and
the
skins
of
deer
that
they
had
killed
but
the
young
philadelphians
unaccustomed
to
the
fury
of
the
elements
in
the
wilderness
looked
upon
it
with
awe
in
the
west
the
lightning
blazed
and
the
thunder
crashed
for
a
long
time
often
the
forest
seemed
to
swim
in
a
red
glare
and
robert
himself
was
forced
to
shut
his
eyes
before
the
rapid
flashes
of
dazzling
brightness
then
came
a
great
rushing
of
wind
with
a
mighty
rain
on
its
edge
and
when
the
wind
died
the
rain
fell
straight
down
in
torrents
more
than
an
hour
although
they
kept
their
ammunition
and
other
supplies
dry
the
men
themselves
were
drenched
to
the
bone
but
the
storm
passed
more
suddenly
than
it
had
come
the
clouds
parted
on
the
horizon
then
all
fled
away
the
last
raindrop
fell
and
a
shining
sun
came
out
in
a
hot
blue
sky
as
the
men
resumed
a
drooping
march
their
clothes
dried
fast
in
the
fiery
rays
and
their
spirits
revived
when
night
came
they
were
dry
again
and
youth
had
taken
no
harm
the
next
day
they
struck
an
indian
trail
but
both
willet
and
tayoga
said
it
had
been
made
by
less
than
a
dozen
warriors
and
that
they
were
going
north
its
my
belief
said
willet
that
they
were
warriors
from
the
ohio
country
on
their
way
to
join
the
french
along
the
canadian
border
and
theyre
not
staying
to
meet
us
said
colden
im
afraid
will
itll
be
some
time
before
you
have
a
chance
to
show
your
unbottled
quaker
valor
perhaps
not
so
long
as
you
think
replied
wilton
who
had
plenty
of
penetration
i
dont
claim
to
be
any
great
forest
rover
although
i
do
think
ive
learned
something
since
i
left
philadelphia
but
i
imagine
that
our
building
of
a
fort
in
the
woods
will
draw
em
the
indian
runners
will
soon
be
carrying
the
news
of
it
and
then
theyll
cluster
around
us
like
flies
seeking
sugar
youre
right
mr
wilton
said
willet
after
we
build
this
fort
its
as
sure
as
the
sun
is
in
the
heavens
that
well
have
to
fight
for
it
two
days
later
they
reached
the
site
for
their
little
fortress
which
they
named
fort
refuge
because
they
intended
it
as
a
place
in
which
harried
settlers
might
find
shelter
it
was
a
hill
near
a
large
creek
and
the
source
of
a
small
brook
lay
within
the
grounds
they
intended
to
occupy
securing
to
them
an
unfailing
supply
of
good
water
in
case
of
siege
now
the
young
soldiers
entered
upon
one
of
the
most
arduous
tasks
of
the
war
to
build
a
fort
which
was
even
more
trying
to
them
than
battle
arms
and
backs
ached
as
colden
wilton
and
carson
advised
by
willet
drove
them
hard
a
strong
log
blockhouse
was
erected
and
then
a
stout
palisade
enclosing
the
house
and
about
an
acre
of
ground
including
the
precious
spring
which
spouted
from
under
a
ledge
of
stone
at
the
very
wall
of
the
blockhouse
itself
behind
the
building
they
raised
a
shed
in
which
the
horses
could
be
sheltered
as
all
of
them
foresaw
a
long
stay
dragging
into
winter
with
its
sleet
and
snow
and
it
was
important
to
save
the
animals
robert
willet
and
tayoga
had
a
roving
commission
and
as
they
could
stay
with
colden
and
his
command
as
long
as
they
chose
they
chose
accordingly
to
remain
where
they
thought
they
could
do
the
most
good
robert
took
little
part
in
the
hunting
but
labored
with
the
soldiers
on
the
building
although
it
was
not
the
kind
of
work
to
which
his
mind
turned
the
blockhouse
itself
was
divided
into
a
number
of
rooms
in
which
the
soldiers
who
were
not
on
guard
could
sleep
and
they
had
blankets
and
the
skins
of
the
larger
animals
the
hunters
killed
for
beds
venison
jerked
in
great
quantities
was
stored
away
in
case
of
siege
and
the
whole
forest
was
made
to
contribute
to
their
larder
the
work
was
hard
but
it
toughened
the
sinews
of
the
young
soldiers
and
gave
them
an
occupation
in
which
they
were
interested
before
it
was
finished
they
were
joined
by
another
small
detachment
with
loaded
pack
horses
which
by
the
same
kind
of
miracle
had
come
safely
through
the
wilderness
colden
now
had
a
hundred
men
fifty
horses
and
powder
and
lead
for
all
the
needs
of
which
one
could
think
if
we
only
had
a
cannon
he
said
looking
proudly
at
their
new
blockhouse
i
think
id
build
a
platform
for
it
there
on
the
roof
and
then
we
could
sweep
the
forest
in
every
direction
eh
will
my
lad
but
as
we
havent
said
wilton
well
have
to
do
the
sweeping
with
our
rifles
and
our
men
are
good
marksmen
as
they
showed
in
that
fight
with
st
luc
but
it
seems
a
world
away
from
philadelphia
doesnt
it
will
i
wonder
what
theyre
doing
there
counting
their
gains
in
the
west
india
trade
looking
at
the
latest
fashions
from
england
that
have
come
on
the
ships
up
the
delaware
building
new
houses
out
germantown
way
none
of
them
thinking
much
of
the
war
except
old
ben
franklin
who
pegs
forever
at
the
governor
of
the
province
the
legislature
and
every
influential
man
to
take
action
before
the
french
and
indians
seize
the
whole
border
i
hope
franklin
will
stir
em
up
and
that
they
wont
forget
us
out
here
in
the
woods
for
us
at
least
the
french
and
indians
are
a
reality
meanwhile
summer
had
turned
into
autumn
and
autumn
itself
was
passing
chapter
v
the
runner
fort
refuge
the
stronghold
raised
by
young
arms
was
the
most
distant
point
in
the
wilderness
held
by
the
angloamerican
forces
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
cut
off
entirely
from
the
world
no
message
came
out
of
the
great
forest
that
rimmed
it
round
but
colden
had
been
told
to
build
it
and
hold
it
until
he
had
orders
to
leave
it
and
he
and
his
men
waited
patiently
until
word
of
some
kind
should
come
or
they
should
be
attacked
by
the
french
and
indian
forces
that
were
gathering
continually
in
the
north
they
saw
the
autumn
reach
its
full
glory
the
wilderness
glowed
in
intense
yellows
and
reds
the
days
grew
cool
and
the
nights
cold
the
air
was
crisp
and
fresh
like
the
breath
of
life
the
young
men
felt
their
muscles
expand
and
their
courage
rise
and
they
longed
for
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
sure
that
behind
their
stout
palisade
they
would
be
able
to
defeat
whatever
numbers
came
tayoga
left
them
early
one
morning
for
a
visit
to
his
people
the
leaves
were
falling
then
under
a
sharp
west
wind
and
the
sky
had
a
cold
hard
tint
of
blue
steel
winter
was
not
far
away
but
the
day
suited
a
runner
like
tayoga
who
wished
to
make
speed
through
the
wilderness
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
strong
slender
figure
outlined
against
the
brown
waved
his
hand
to
his
friends
watching
on
the
palisade
and
then
disappeared
a
great
indian
said
young
wilton
thoughtfully
i
confess
that
i
never
knew
much
about
the
red
men
or
thought
much
about
them
until
i
met
him
i
dont
recall
having
come
into
contact
with
a
finer
mind
of
its
kind
most
of
the
white
people
make
the
mistake
of
undervaluing
the
indians
said
robert
but
well
learn
in
this
war
what
a
power
they
are
if
the
hodenosaunee
had
turned
against
us
wed
have
been
beaten
already
at
any
rate
tayoga
is
a
noble
type
since
i
had
to
come
into
the
forest
im
glad
to
meet
such
fellows
as
he
do
you
think
lennox
that
hell
get
through
safely
robert
laughed
get
through
safely
he
repeated
why
tayoga
is
the
fastest
runner
among
the
indian
nations
and
they
train
for
speed
he
goes
like
the
wind
he
never
tires
night
and
day
are
the
same
to
him
hes
so
light
of
foot
that
he
could
pass
through
a
band
of
his
own
comrades
and
they
would
never
know
he
was
there
and
yet
his
own
ears
are
so
keen
that
he
can
hear
the
leaves
falling
a
hundred
yards
away
the
path
from
here
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
may
be
lined
on
either
side
with
the
french
and
the
hostile
tribes
standing
as
thick
as
trees
in
the
forest
but
he
will
flit
between
them
as
safely
and
easily
as
you
and
i
would
ride
along
a
highroad
into
philadelphia
he
will
arrive
at
the
vale
of
onondaga
unharmed
at
the
exact
minute
he
intends
to
arrive
and
he
will
return
reaching
fort
refuge
also
on
the
exact
day
and
at
the
exact
hour
and
minute
he
has
already
selected
the
young
quaker
surveyed
robert
with
admiration
and
then
laughed
what
they
tell
of
you
is
true
he
said
in
truth
that
was
a
most
gorgeous
and
rounded
speech
you
made
about
your
friend
i
dont
recall
finer
and
more
flowing
periods
what
vividness
what
imagery
im
proud
to
know
you
lennox
robert
reddened
and
then
laughed
i
do
grow
enthusiastic
when
i
talk
about
tayoga
he
said
but
youll
see
that
what
i
predict
will
come
to
pass
hes
probably
told
willet
just
when
hell
be
back
at
fort
refuge
well
ask
him
the
hunter
informed
them
that
tayoga
intended
to
take
exactly
ten
days
this
is
monday
he
said
hell
be
here
a
week
from
next
thursday
at
noon
but
suppose
something
happens
to
detain
him
said
wilton
suppose
the
weather
is
too
bad
for
traveling
or
suppose
a
lot
of
other
things
that
can
happen
easily
willet
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
such
a
case
as
this
where
tayoga
is
concerned
he
said
we
dont
suppose
anything
we
go
by
certainties
before
he
left
tayoga
settled
the
day
and
the
hour
when
he
would
return
and
its
not
now
a
problem
or
a
question
he
has
disposed
of
the
subject
i
cant
quite
see
it
that
way
said
wilton
tenaciously
i
admit
that
tayoga
is
a
wonderful
fellow
but
he
cannot
possibly
tell
the
exact
hour
of
his
return
from
such
a
journey
as
the
one
he
has
undertaken
you
wait
and
see
said
the
hunter
in
the
utmost
good
nature
you
think
you
know
tayoga
but
you
dont
yet
know
him
fully
if
i
were
not
a
quaker
id
wager
a
small
sum
of
money
that
he
does
not
come
at
the
time
appointed
said
wilton
then
its
lucky
for
your
pocket
that
youre
a
quaker
laughed
willet
it
turned
much
colder
that
very
afternoon
and
the
raw
edge
of
winter
showed
the
wind
from
the
northwest
was
bitter
and
the
dead
leaves
fell
in
showers
at
dusk
a
chilling
rain
began
and
the
young
soldiers
shivering
were
glad
enough
to
seek
the
shelter
of
the
blockhouse
where
a
great
fire
was
blazing
on
the
broad
hearth
they
had
made
many
rude
camp
stools
and
sitting
down
on
one
before
the
blaze
wilton
let
the
pleasant
warmth
fall
upon
his
face
im
sorry
for
tayoga
he
said
to
robert
just
when
you
and
willet
were
boasting
most
about
him
this
winter
rain
had
to
come
and
he
was
no
more
than
fairly
started
hell
have
to
hunt
a
den
somewhere
in
the
forest
and
crouch
in
it
wrapped
in
his
blanket
robert
smiled
serenely
den
crouch
wrapped
in
his
blanket
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
his
mellow
golden
voice
are
you
speaking
of
my
friend
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
can
it
be
possible
wilton
that
you
are
referring
to
him
when
you
talk
of
such
humiliating
subterfuges
i
refer
to
him
and
none
other
lennox
i
see
him
now
stumbling
about
in
the
deep
forest
looking
for
shelter
no
wilton
you
dont
see
tayoga
you
merely
see
an
idle
figment
of
a
brain
that
does
not
yet
fully
know
my
friend
the
great
young
onondaga
but
i
see
him
and
i
see
him
clearly
i
behold
a
tall
strong
figure
head
slightly
bent
against
the
rain
eyes
that
see
in
the
dark
as
well
as
yours
see
in
the
brightest
sunlight
feet
that
move
surely
and
steadily
in
the
path
never
stumbling
and
never
veering
tireless
muscles
that
carry
him
on
without
slackening
dithyrambic
again
lennox
you
are
certainly
loyal
to
your
friend
as
for
me
im
glad
im
not
out
there
in
the
black
and
wet
forest
no
human
being
can
keep
to
his
pace
at
such
a
time
robert
again
smiled
serenely
but
he
said
nothing
more
his
confidence
was
unlimited
presently
he
wrapped
around
his
body
a
rude
but
serviceable
overcoat
of
beaver
skin
that
he
had
made
for
himself
and
went
out
the
cold
drizzling
icy
rain
that
creeps
into
ones
veins
was
still
falling
and
he
shivered
despite
his
furs
he
looked
toward
the
northeast
whither
tayogas
course
took
him
and
he
felt
sorry
for
his
red
comrade
but
he
never
doubted
that
he
was
speeding
on
his
way
with
sure
and
unfaltering
step
the
sentinels
mounted
on
the
broad
plank
that
ran
behind
the
palisade
were
walking
to
and
fro
wrapped
to
their
eyes
a
month
or
two
earlier
they
might
have
left
everything
on
such
a
night
to
take
care
of
itself
but
now
they
knew
far
better
captain
colden
with
the
terrible
lesson
of
the
battle
in
the
bush
had
become
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
willet
was
always
at
his
elbow
with
unobtrusive
but
valuable
advice
which
the
young
philadelphian
had
the
good
sense
to
welcome
robert
spoke
to
them
and
one
or
two
referred
to
the
indian
runner
who
had
gone
east
saying
that
he
might
have
had
a
better
night
for
his
start
the
repetition
of
wiltons
words
depressed
robert
for
a
moment
but
his
heart
came
back
with
a
bound
nothing
could
defeat
tayoga
did
he
not
know
his
red
comrade
the
wilderness
was
like
a
trimmed
garden
to
him
and
neither
rain
nor
hail
nor
snow
could
stop
him
as
he
said
the
word
hail
to
himself
it
came
pattering
upon
the
dead
leaves
and
the
palisade
in
a
whirlwind
of
white
pellets
again
he
shivered
and
knowing
it
was
no
use
to
linger
there
returned
inside
where
most
of
the
men
had
already
gone
to
sleep
he
stretched
himself
on
his
blanket
and
followed
them
in
slumber
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
it
was
still
hailing
and
wilton
said
in
a
serious
tone
that
he
hoped
tayoga
would
give
up
the
journey
and
come
back
to
fort
refuge
i
like
that
onondaga
he
said
and
i
dont
want
him
to
freeze
to
death
in
the
forest
why
the
earth
and
all
the
trees
are
coated
with
ice
now
and
even
if
a
man
lives
he
is
able
to
make
no
progress
once
more
robert
smiled
serenely
youre
thinking
of
the
men
you
knew
in
philadelphia
will
he
said
they
of
course
couldnt
make
such
a
flight
through
a
white
forest
but
tayoga
is
an
altogether
different
kind
of
fellow
hell
merely
exert
himself
a
little
more
and
go
on
as
fast
as
ever
wilton
looked
at
the
vast
expanse
of
glittering
ice
and
then
drew
the
folds
of
a
heavy
cloak
more
closely
about
his
body
i
rejoice
he
said
that
its
the
onondaga
and
not
myself
who
has
to
make
the
great
journey
i
rejoice
too
that
we
have
built
this
fort
its
not
philadelphia
that
fine
true
comfortable
city
but
its
shelter
against
the
hard
winter
that
i
see
coming
so
fast
colden
still
following
the
advice
of
willet
kept
his
men
busy
knowing
that
idleness
bred
discontent
and
destroyed
discipline
at
least
a
dozen
soldiers
taught
by
willet
and
robert
had
developed
into
excellent
hunters
and
as
the
game
was
abundant
owing
to
the
absence
of
indians
they
had
killed
deer
bear
panther
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
animals
that
ranged
these
forests
the
flesh
of
such
as
were
edible
was
cured
and
stored
as
they
foresaw
the
day
when
many
people
might
be
in
fort
refuge
and
the
food
would
be
needed
the
skins
also
were
dressed
and
were
put
upon
the
floor
or
hung
upon
the
walls
the
young
men
working
hard
were
happy
nevertheless
as
they
were
continually
learning
new
arts
and
the
life
was
healthy
to
an
extraordinary
degree
all
the
wounded
were
as
whole
as
before
and
everybody
acquired
new
and
stronger
muscles
their
content
would
have
been
yet
greater
in
degree
had
they
been
able
to
learn
what
was
going
on
outside
in
that
vast
world
where
france
and
britain
and
their
colonies
contended
so
fiercely
for
the
mastery
but
they
looked
at
the
wall
of
the
forest
and
it
was
a
blank
they
were
shut
away
from
all
things
as
completely
as
crusoe
on
his
island
nor
would
they
hear
a
single
whisper
until
tayoga
came
backif
he
came
back
on
the
second
day
after
the
onondagas
departure
the
air
softened
but
became
darker
the
glittering
white
of
the
forest
assumed
a
more
somber
tinge
clouds
marched
up
in
solemn
procession
from
the
southwest
and
mobilized
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
a
wind
touched
with
damp
blew
robert
knew
very
well
what
the
elements
portended
and
again
he
was
sorry
for
tayoga
but
as
before
after
the
first
few
moments
of
discouragement
his
courage
leaped
up
higher
than
ever
his
brilliant
imagination
at
once
painted
a
picture
in
which
every
detail
was
vivid
and
full
of
life
and
this
picture
was
of
a
vast
forest
trees
and
bushes
alike
clothed
in
ice
and
in
the
center
of
it
a
slender
figure
but
straight
tall
and
strong
tayoga
himself
speeding
on
like
the
arrow
from
the
bow
never
wavering
never
weary
then
his
mind
allowed
the
picture
to
fade
wilton
might
not
believe
tayoga
could
succeed
but
how
could
this
young
quaker
know
tayoga
as
he
knew
him
the
clouds
having
finished
their
mobilization
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
soon
spread
to
the
horizon
on
every
side
then
a
single
great
white
flake
dropped
slowly
and
gracefully
from
the
zenith
fell
within
the
palisade
and
melted
before
the
eyes
of
robert
and
wilton
but
it
was
merely
a
herald
of
its
fellows
which
descending
at
first
like
skirmishers
soon
thickened
into
companies
regiments
brigades
divisions
and
armies
then
all
the
air
was
filled
with
the
flakes
and
they
were
so
thick
they
could
not
see
the
forest
the
first
snow
of
the
winter
and
a
big
one
said
wilton
and
again
i
give
thanks
for
our
well
furnished
fort
there
may
be
greater
fortresses
in
europe
and
of
a
certainty
there
are
many
more
famous
but
there
is
none
finer
to
me
than
this
with
its
stout
log
walls
its
strong
broad
roofs
and
its
abundance
of
supplies
once
more
though
im
sorry
for
your
friend
tayoga
a
runner
may
go
fast
over
ice
if
hes
extremely
sure
of
foot
and
his
moccasins
are
good
but
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
he
can
speed
like
the
gull
in
its
flight
through
deep
snow
not
through
the
snow
but
he
may
be
on
it
said
robert
and
how
on
it
wise
but
cryptic
young
sir
snow
shoes
but
he
took
none
with
him
and
had
none
to
take
which
proves
nothing
the
indians
often
hide
in
the
forest
articles
theyll
need
at
some
far
day
a
canoe
may
be
concealed
in
a
thicket
at
the
creeks
edge
a
bow
and
arrows
may
be
thrust
away
under
a
ledge
all
awaiting
the
coming
of
their
owner
when
he
needs
them
most
the
chance
seems
too
small
to
me
lennox
i
cant
think
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
will
rise
out
of
the
forest
just
when
tayoga
wants
em
walk
up
to
him
and
say
please
strap
us
on
your
feet
i
make
concession
freely
that
the
onondaga
is
a
most
wonderful
fellow
but
he
cant
work
miracles
he
does
not
hold
such
complete
mastery
over
the
wilderness
that
it
will
obey
his
lightest
whisper
i
read
fairy
tales
in
my
youth
and
they
pleased
me
much
but
alas
they
were
fairy
tales
the
impossible
doesnt
happen
whos
the
great
talker
now
your
words
were
flowing
then
like
the
trickling
of
water
from
a
spout
but
youre
wrong
will
about
the
impossible
the
impossible
often
happens
great
spirits
like
tayoga
love
the
impossible
it
draws
them
on
it
arouses
their
energy
they
think
it
worth
while
ive
seen
tayoga
more
than
once
since
he
started
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
will
now
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
behold
him
once
more
hes
in
the
forest
the
snow
is
pouring
down
it
lies
a
foot
deep
on
the
ground
the
boughs
bend
with
it
and
sometimes
they
crack
under
it
with
a
report
like
that
of
a
rifle
the
tops
of
the
bushes
crowned
with
white
bend
their
weight
toward
the
ground
the
panthers
the
wolves
and
the
wildcats
all
lie
snug
in
their
dens
its
a
dead
world
save
for
one
figure
squarely
in
the
center
of
it
i
see
tayoga
bent
over
a
little
but
flying
straight
forward
at
a
speed
that
neither
you
nor
i
could
match
will
his
feet
do
not
sink
in
the
snow
he
skims
upon
it
like
a
swallow
through
the
air
his
feet
are
encased
in
something
long
and
narrow
he
has
on
snow
shoes
and
he
goes
like
the
wind
you
do
have
supreme
confidence
in
the
onondaga
lennox
so
would
you
if
you
knew
him
as
i
do
will
a
truth
ive
told
you
several
times
already
but
he
cant
provide
for
every
emergency
must
i
tell
you
for
the
twentieth
time
that
you
dont
know
tayoga
as
i
know
him
no
lennox
but
ill
wait
and
see
what
happens
the
fall
of
snow
lasted
the
entire
day
and
the
following
night
the
wilderness
was
singularly
beautiful
but
it
was
also
inaccessible
comfortable
for
those
in
the
fort
but
outside
the
snow
lay
nearly
two
feet
deep
i
hope
that
vision
of
yours
comes
true
said
wilton
to
robert
as
they
looked
at
the
forest
they
say
the
highland
scotch
can
go
into
trances
or
something
of
that
kind
and
look
into
the
future
and
i
believe
the
indians
claim
the
gift
but
ive
never
heard
that
english
and
americans
assumed
the
possession
of
such
powers
im
no
seer
laughed
robert
i
merely
use
my
imagination
and
produce
for
myself
a
picture
of
things
two
or
three
days
ahead
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
well
well
see
i
take
so
great
an
interest
in
the
journey
of
your
onondaga
friend
that
somehow
i
feel
myself
traveling
along
with
him
i
know
im
going
with
him
or
i
wouldnt
have
seen
him
flying
ahead
on
his
snow
shoes
but
come
will
ive
promised
to
teach
you
how
to
sew
buckskin
with
tendons
and
sinews
and
im
going
to
see
that
you
do
it
the
snow
despite
its
great
depth
was
premature
because
on
the
fourth
day
soft
winds
began
to
blow
and
all
the
following
night
a
warm
rain
fell
it
came
down
so
fast
that
the
whole
earth
was
flooded
and
the
air
was
all
fog
and
mist
the
creek
rose
far
beyond
its
banks
and
the
water
stood
in
pools
and
lakes
in
the
forest
now
in
very
truth
our
friend
tayoga
has
been
compelled
to
seek
a
lair
said
wilton
emphatically
his
snow
shoes
would
be
the
sorriest
of
drags
upon
his
feet
in
mud
and
water
and
without
them
he
will
sink
to
his
knees
the
wilderness
has
become
impassable
robert
laughed
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
for
him
said
wilton
but
i
do
then
what
in
heavens
name
is
it
i
not
only
see
the
way
for
tayoga
but
i
shut
my
eyes
once
more
and
i
see
him
using
it
he
has
put
away
his
snow
shoes
and
going
to
the
thick
bushes
at
the
edge
of
a
creek
he
has
taken
out
his
hidden
canoe
he
has
been
in
it
some
time
and
with
mighty
sweeps
of
the
paddle
that
he
knows
so
well
how
to
use
it
flies
like
a
wild
duck
over
the
water
now
he
passes
from
the
creek
into
a
river
flowing
eastward
and
swollen
by
the
floods
to
a
vast
width
the
rain
has
poured
upon
him
but
he
does
not
mind
it
the
powerful
exercise
with
the
paddles
dries
his
body
and
sends
the
pleasant
warmth
through
every
vein
his
feet
and
ankles
rest
after
his
long
flight
on
the
snow
shoes
and
his
heart
swells
with
pleasure
because
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
parts
of
his
journey
his
rifle
is
lying
by
his
side
and
he
could
seize
it
in
a
moment
should
an
enemy
appear
but
the
forest
on
either
side
of
the
stream
is
deserted
and
he
speeds
on
unhindered
there
may
be
better
canoemen
in
the
world
than
tayoga
but
i
doubt
it
come
come
lennox
you
go
too
far
i
can
admit
the
possibility
of
the
snow
shoes
and
their
appearance
at
the
very
moment
theyre
needed
but
the
evocation
of
a
river
and
a
canoe
at
the
opportune
instant
puts
too
high
a
strain
upon
credibility
then
dont
believe
it
unless
you
wish
to
do
so
laughed
robert
but
as
for
me
im
not
only
believing
it
but
im
almost
at
the
stage
of
knowing
it
the
flood
was
so
great
that
all
hunting
ceased
for
the
time
and
the
men
stayed
under
shelter
in
the
fort
while
the
fires
were
kept
burning
for
the
sake
of
both
warmth
and
cheer
but
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
great
ohio
valley
where
changes
in
temperature
are
often
rapid
and
violent
the
warm
rain
ceased
the
wind
came
out
of
the
southwest
cold
and
then
colder
the
logs
of
the
buildings
popped
with
the
contracting
cold
all
through
the
following
night
and
the
next
dawn
came
bright
clear
and
still
but
far
below
zero
the
ice
was
thick
on
the
creek
and
every
new
pool
and
lake
was
covered
the
trees
and
bushes
that
had
been
dripping
the
day
before
were
sheathed
in
silver
mail
breath
curled
away
like
smoke
from
the
lips
if
tayoga
stayed
in
his
canoe
said
wilton
hes
frozen
solidly
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
he
wont
be
able
to
move
it
until
a
thaw
comes
robert
laughed
with
genuine
amusement
and
also
with
a
certain
scorn
ive
told
you
many
times
will
he
said
that
you
didnt
know
all
about
tayoga
but
now
it
seems
that
you
know
nothing
about
him
well
then
wherein
am
i
wrong
sir
robert
the
omniscient
asked
wilton
in
your
assumption
that
tayoga
would
not
foresee
what
was
coming
having
spent
nearly
all
his
life
with
nature
he
has
naturally
been
forced
to
observe
all
of
its
manifestations
even
the
most
delicate
and
when
you
add
to
these
necessities
the
powers
of
an
exceedingly
strong
and
penetrating
mind
you
have
developed
faculties
that
can
cope
with
almost
anything
tayoga
foresaw
this
big
freeze
and
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
he
did
as
accurately
as
if
i
had
been
there
and
had
seen
it
he
kept
to
the
river
and
his
canoe
almost
until
the
first
thin
skim
of
ice
began
to
show
then
he
paddled
to
land
and
hid
the
canoe
again
among
thick
bushes
he
raised
it
up
a
little
on
low
boughs
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
not
touch
the
water
thus
it
was
safe
from
the
ice
and
so
leaving
it
well
hidden
and
in
proper
condition
and
situation
he
sped
on
of
course
youre
a
master
with
words
robert
and
the
longer
they
are
the
better
you
seem
to
like
em
but
how
is
the
onondaga
to
make
speed
over
the
ice
which
now
covers
the
earth
snow
shoes
i
take
it
would
not
be
available
upon
such
a
smooth
and
tricky
surface
and
at
any
rate
he
has
left
them
far
behind
in
part
of
your
assumption
youre
right
will
tayoga
hasnt
the
snow
shoes
now
and
he
wouldnt
use
em
if
he
had
em
he
foresaw
the
possibility
of
the
freeze
and
took
with
him
in
his
pack
a
pair
of
heavy
moose
skin
moccasins
with
the
hair
on
the
outside
theyre
so
rough
they
do
not
slip
on
the
ice
especially
when
they
inclose
the
feet
of
a
runner
so
wiry
so
agile
and
so
experienced
as
tayoga
once
more
i
close
my
eyes
and
i
see
his
brown
figure
shooting
through
the
white
forest
he
goes
even
faster
than
he
did
when
he
had
on
the
snow
shoes
because
whenever
he
comes
to
a
slope
he
throws
himself
back
upon
his
heels
and
lets
himself
slide
down
the
ice
almost
at
the
speed
of
a
bird
darting
through
the
air
if
youre
right
lennox
your
red
friend
is
not
merely
a
marvel
but
a
series
of
marvels
im
right
will
i
do
not
doubt
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
tenth
day
when
tayoga
arrives
on
the
return
from
the
vale
of
onondaga
you
will
gladly
admit
the
truth
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
my
gladness
lennox
if
it
should
come
true
but
the
elements
seem
to
have
conspired
against
him
and
ive
learned
that
in
the
wilderness
the
elements
count
very
heavily
earth
fire
and
water
may
all
join
against
him
but
at
the
time
appointed
he
will
come
i
know
it
the
great
cold
and
it
was
hard
fierce
and
bitter
lasted
two
days
at
night
the
popping
of
the
contracting
timbers
sounded
like
a
continuous
pistol
fire
but
willet
had
foreseen
everything
at
his
instance
colden
had
made
the
young
soldiers
gather
vast
quantities
of
fuel
long
ago
from
a
forest
which
was
filled
everywhere
with
dead
boughs
and
fallen
timber
the
accumulation
of
scores
of
years
then
another
great
thaw
came
and
the
fickle
climate
proceeded
to
show
what
it
could
do
when
the
thaw
had
been
going
on
for
a
day
and
a
night
a
terrific
winter
hurricane
broke
over
the
forest
trees
were
shattered
as
if
their
trunks
had
been
shot
through
by
huge
cannon
balls
here
and
there
long
windrows
were
piled
up
and
vast
areas
were
a
litter
of
broken
boughs
as
i
reckon
and
allowing
for
the
marvels
you
say
he
can
perform
tayoga
is
now
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
lennox
said
wilton
its
lucky
that
hes
there
in
the
comfortable
log
houses
of
his
own
people
because
a
man
could
scarcely
live
in
the
forest
in
such
a
storm
as
this
as
he
would
be
beaten
to
death
by
flying
timbers
this
time
will
youre
wrong
in
both
assumptions
tayoga
has
already
been
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
he
has
spent
there
the
half
day
that
he
allowed
to
himself
and
now
on
the
return
journey
has
left
the
vale
far
behind
him
i
told
you
how
sensitive
he
was
to
the
changes
of
the
weather
and
he
knew
it
was
coming
several
hours
before
it
arrived
he
sought
at
once
protection
probably
a
cleft
in
the
rock
or
an
opening
of
two
or
three
feet
under
a
stony
ledge
he
is
lying
there
now
just
as
snug
and
safe
as
you
please
while
this
storm
which
covers
a
vast
area
rages
over
his
head
there
is
much
that
is
primeval
in
tayoga
and
his
comfort
and
safety
make
him
fairly
enjoy
the
storm
as
he
lies
under
the
ledge
with
his
blanket
drawn
around
him
he
is
warm
and
dry
and
his
sense
of
comfort
contrasting
his
pleasant
little
den
with
the
fierce
storm
without
becomes
one
of
luxury
i
suppose
of
course
lennox
that
you
can
shut
your
eyes
and
see
him
once
more
without
any
trouble
in
all
truth
and
certainty
i
can
will
he
is
lying
on
a
stone
shelf
with
a
stone
ledge
above
him
his
blanket
takes
away
the
hardness
of
the
stone
that
supports
him
he
sees
boughs
and
sticks
whirled
past
by
the
storm
but
none
of
them
touches
him
he
hears
the
wind
whistling
and
screaming
at
a
pitch
so
fierce
that
it
would
terrify
one
unused
to
the
forest
but
it
is
only
a
song
in
the
ears
of
tayoga
it
soothes
him
it
lulls
him
and
knowing
that
he
cant
use
the
period
of
the
storm
for
traveling
he
uses
it
for
sleep
thus
enabling
him
to
take
less
later
on
when
the
storm
has
ceased
so
after
all
he
loses
nothing
so
far
as
his
journey
is
concerned
now
his
lids
droop
his
eyes
close
and
he
slumbers
while
the
storm
thunders
past
unable
to
touch
him
you
do
have
the
gift
lennox
i
believe
that
sometimes
your
words
are
music
in
your
own
ears
and
inspire
you
to
greater
efforts
when
the
war
is
over
you
must
surely
become
a
public
manone
who
is
often
called
upon
to
address
the
people
well
fight
the
war
first
laughed
robert
the
storm
in
its
rise
its
zenith
and
its
decline
lasted
several
hours
and
when
it
was
over
the
forest
looked
like
a
wreck
but
robert
knew
that
nature
would
soon
restore
everything
the
foliage
of
next
spring
would
cover
up
the
ruin
and
new
growth
would
take
the
place
of
the
old
and
broken
the
wilderness
forever
restoring
what
was
lost
always
took
care
of
itself
a
day
or
two
of
fine
clear
winter
weather
not
too
cold
followed
and
willet
went
forth
to
scout
he
was
gone
until
the
next
morning
and
when
he
returned
his
face
was
very
grave
there
are
indians
in
the
forest
he
said
not
friendly
warriors
of
the
hodenosaunee
but
those
allied
with
the
enemy
i
think
a
formidable
ojibway
band
under
tandakora
is
there
and
also
other
indians
from
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
they
may
have
started
against
us
some
time
back
but
were
probably
halted
by
the
bad
weather
theyre
in
different
bodies
now
scattered
perhaps
for
hunting
but
theyll
reunite
before
long
did
you
see
signs
of
any
white
men
dave
asked
robert
yes
french
officers
and
some
soldiers
are
with
em
but
i
dont
think
st
luc
is
in
the
number
more
likely
its
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
whom
we
have
such
good
cause
to
remember
i
hope
so
dave
id
rather
fight
against
those
two
than
against
st
luc
so
would
i
and
for
several
reasons
st
luc
is
a
better
leader
than
they
are
theyre
able
but
hes
the
best
of
all
the
french
that
afternoon
two
men
who
ventured
a
short
distance
from
fort
refuge
were
shot
at
and
one
was
wounded
slightly
but
both
were
able
to
regain
the
little
fortress
willet
slipped
out
again
and
reported
the
forest
swarming
with
indians
although
there
was
yet
no
indication
of
a
preconcerted
attack
still
it
was
well
for
the
garrison
to
keep
close
and
take
every
precaution
and
this
shuts
out
tayoga
said
wilton
regretfully
to
robert
he
may
make
his
way
through
rain
and
flood
and
sleet
and
snow
and
hurricane
but
he
can
never
pass
those
watchful
hordes
of
indians
in
the
woods
once
more
the
onondagas
loyal
friend
laughed
the
warriors
turn
tayoga
back
will
he
said
he
will
pass
through
em
just
as
if
they
were
not
there
the
time
will
be
up
day
after
tomorrow
at
noon
and
then
he
will
be
here
even
if
the
indians
move
up
and
besiege
us
in
regular
form
even
that
and
even
anything
else
at
noon
day
after
tomorrow
tayoga
will
be
here
another
man
who
went
out
to
bring
in
a
horse
that
had
been
left
grazing
near
the
fort
was
fired
upon
not
with
rifles
or
muskets
but
with
arrows
and
grazed
in
the
shoulder
he
had
however
the
presence
of
mind
to
spring
upon
the
animals
back
and
gallop
for
fort
refuge
where
the
watchful
willet
threw
open
the
gate
to
the
stockade
let
him
in
then
quickly
closed
and
barred
it
fast
a
long
fierce
whining
cry
the
war
whoop
came
from
the
forest
the
siege
has
closed
in
already
said
robert
and
its
well
that
we
have
no
other
men
outside
except
tayoga
said
wilton
the
barrier
of
the
red
army
doesnt
count
so
far
as
tayoga
is
concerned
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
will
that
tayoga
will
come
at
the
time
appointed
after
the
shout
from
the
woods
there
was
a
long
silence
that
weighed
upon
the
young
soldiers
isolated
thus
in
the
wintry
and
desolate
wilderness
they
were
city
men
used
to
the
streets
and
the
sounds
of
people
and
their
situation
had
many
aspects
that
were
weird
and
appalling
they
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
civilization
and
around
them
everywhere
stretched
a
black
forest
hiding
a
tenacious
and
cruel
foe
but
on
the
other
hand
their
stockade
was
stout
they
had
plenty
of
ammunition
water
and
provisions
and
one
victory
already
to
their
credit
after
the
first
moments
of
depression
they
recalled
their
courage
and
eagerly
awaited
an
attack
but
the
attack
did
not
come
and
robert
knew
it
would
not
be
made
at
least
not
yet
the
indians
were
too
wary
to
batter
themselves
to
pieces
against
the
palisade
and
the
frenchmen
with
them
skilled
in
forest
war
would
hold
them
back
perhaps
theyve
gone
away
realizing
that
were
too
strong
for
em
said
wilton
thats
just
what
we
must
guard
against
said
robert
the
indian
fights
with
trick
and
stratagem
he
always
has
more
time
than
the
white
man
and
he
is
wholly
willing
to
wait
they
want
us
to
think
theyve
left
and
then
theyll
cut
off
the
incautious
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
the
silence
which
had
grown
oppressive
persisted
a
light
pleasant
wind
blew
through
the
forest
which
was
now
dry
and
the
dead
bark
and
wintry
branches
rustled
to
many
of
the
youths
it
became
a
forest
of
gloom
and
threat
and
they
asked
impatiently
why
the
warriors
did
not
come
out
and
show
themselves
like
men
certainly
it
did
not
become
frenchmen
if
they
were
there
to
lurk
in
the
woods
and
seek
ambush
willet
was
the
pervading
spirit
of
the
defense
deft
in
word
and
action
acknowledging
at
all
times
that
colden
was
the
commander
thus
saving
the
young
philadelphians
pride
in
the
presence
of
his
men
he
contrived
in
an
unobtrusive
way
to
direct
everything
the
guards
were
placed
at
suitable
intervals
about
the
palisade
and
were
instructed
to
fire
at
anything
suspicious
the
others
were
compelled
to
stay
in
the
blockhouse
and
take
their
ease
in
order
that
their
nerves
might
be
steady
and
true
when
the
time
for
battle
came
the
cooks
were
also
instructed
to
prepare
an
unusually
bountiful
supper
for
them
robert
was
willets
right
hand
next
to
the
hunter
he
knew
most
about
the
wilderness
and
the
ways
of
its
red
people
there
was
no
possibility
that
the
indians
had
gone
even
if
they
did
not
undertake
to
storm
the
fort
they
would
linger
near
it
in
the
hope
of
cutting
off
men
who
came
forth
incautiously
and
at
night
especially
if
it
happened
to
be
dark
they
would
be
sure
to
come
very
close
the
palisade
was
about
eight
feet
high
and
the
men
stood
on
a
horizontal
plank
three
feet
from
the
ground
leaving
only
the
head
to
project
above
the
shelter
and
willet
warned
them
to
be
exceedingly
careful
when
the
twilight
came
since
the
besiegers
would
undoubtedly
use
the
darkness
as
a
cover
for
sharpshooting
then
both
he
and
robert
looked
anxiously
at
the
sun
which
was
just
setting
behind
the
black
waste
the
night
will
be
dark
said
the
hunter
and
thats
bad
im
afraid
some
of
our
sentinels
will
be
picked
off
robert
you
and
i
must
not
sleep
until
tomorrow
we
must
stay
on
watch
here
all
the
while
as
he
predicted
the
night
came
down
black
and
grim
vast
banks
of
darkness
rolled
up
close
to
the
palisade
and
the
forest
showed
but
dimly
then
the
warriors
proved
to
the
most
incredulous
that
they
had
not
gone
far
away
scattered
shots
were
fired
from
the
woods
and
one
sentinel
who
in
spite
of
warnings
thrust
his
head
too
high
above
the
palisade
received
a
bullet
through
it
falling
back
dead
it
was
a
terrible
lesson
but
afterwards
the
others
took
no
risks
although
they
were
anxious
to
fire
on
hostile
figures
that
their
fancy
saw
for
them
among
the
trees
willet
robert
and
colden
compelled
them
to
withhold
their
fire
until
a
real
and
tangible
enemy
appeared
later
in
the
night
burning
arrows
were
discharged
in
showers
and
fell
within
the
palisade
some
on
the
buildings
but
they
had
pails
and
an
unfailing
spring
and
they
easily
put
out
the
flames
although
one
man
was
struck
and
suffered
both
a
burn
and
a
bruise
toward
midnight
a
terrific
succession
of
war
whoops
came
and
a
great
number
of
warriors
charged
in
the
darkness
against
the
palisade
the
garrison
was
ready
and
despite
the
darkness
poured
forth
such
a
fierce
fire
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
horde
vanished
leaving
behind
several
still
forms
which
they
stole
away
later
another
of
the
young
philadelphians
was
killed
and
before
dawn
he
and
his
comrade
who
had
been
slain
earlier
in
the
evening
were
buried
behind
the
blockhouse
at
intervals
in
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
warriors
fired
either
arrows
or
bullets
doing
no
farther
damage
except
the
slight
wounding
of
one
man
and
when
day
came
willet
and
robert
worn
to
the
bone
sought
a
little
rest
and
sleep
in
the
blockhouse
they
knew
that
golden
could
not
be
surprised
while
the
sun
was
shining
and
that
the
savages
were
not
likely
to
attempt
anything
serious
until
the
following
night
so
they
felt
they
were
not
needed
for
the
present
robert
slept
until
nearly
noon
when
he
ate
heartily
of
the
abundant
food
one
of
the
young
cooks
had
prepared
and
learned
that
beyond
an
occasional
arrow
or
bullet
the
forest
had
given
forth
no
threat
his
own
spirits
rose
high
with
the
day
which
was
uncommonly
brilliant
with
a
great
sun
shining
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
wilton
was
near
the
blockhouse
and
was
confident
about
the
siege
but
worried
about
tayoga
you
tell
me
that
the
indians
wont
go
away
he
said
and
if
youre
right
and
i
think
you
are
the
onondaga
is
surely
shut
off
from
fort
refuge
robert
smiled
i
tell
you
for
the
last
time
that
he
will
come
at
the
appointed
hour
he
said
a
long
day
began
hours
that
seemed
days
in
themselves
passed
and
quiet
prevailed
in
the
forest
although
the
young
soldiers
no
longer
had
any
belief
that
the
warriors
had
gone
away
chapter
vi
the
return
it
was
near
the
close
of
a
day
that
had
been
marked
by
little
demonstration
from
the
enemy
and
the
young
officers
growing
used
to
the
siege
attained
a
philosophical
state
of
mind
they
felt
sure
they
could
hold
the
palisade
against
any
number
of
enemies
and
the
foresight
of
willet
robert
and
tayoga
had
been
so
great
that
by
no
possibility
could
they
be
starved
out
they
began
now
to
have
a
certain
exultation
they
were
inside
comfortable
walls
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
while
the
enemy
was
outside
and
must
forage
for
game
if
it
were
not
for
tayoga
said
wilton
to
robert
i
should
feel
more
than
satisfied
with
the
situation
but
the
fate
of
your
onondaga
friend
sticks
in
my
mind
mr
willet
who
knows
everything
says
were
surrounded
completely
and
i
dont
wish
him
to
lose
his
life
in
an
attempt
to
get
through
at
a
certain
time
merely
on
a
point
of
honor
its
no
point
of
honor
will
its
just
the
completion
of
a
plan
at
the
time
and
place
chosen
do
you
see
anything
in
that
tall
tree
to
the
east
of
the
palisade
something
appears
to
be
moving
up
the
trunk
but
as
its
on
the
far
side
i
catch
only
a
glimpse
of
it
thats
an
indian
warrior
seeking
a
place
for
a
shot
at
us
hell
reach
the
high
fork
but
hell
always
keep
well
behind
the
body
of
the
tree
its
really
too
far
for
a
bullet
but
i
think
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
slip
back
under
cover
the
sharpshooter
reached
his
desired
station
and
fired
but
his
bullet
fell
short
he
tried
three
more
all
without
avail
and
then
willet
picked
him
off
with
his
long
and
deadly
rifle
robert
shut
his
eyes
when
he
saw
the
body
begin
its
fall
but
his
vivid
imagination
so
easily
excited
made
him
hear
its
thump
when
it
struck
the
earth
and
so
ends
that
attempt
he
said
an
hour
later
he
saw
a
white
flag
among
the
trees
and
when
willet
mounted
the
palisade
two
french
officers
came
forward
robert
saw
at
once
that
they
were
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
and
his
heart
beat
hard
they
linked
him
with
quebec
in
which
he
had
spent
some
momentous
days
and
despite
their
treachery
to
him
he
did
not
feel
hatred
of
them
at
that
moment
will
you
stay
with
me
mr
willet
and
you
also
mr
lennox
while
i
talk
to
them
asked
captain
colden
you
know
these
frenchmen
better
than
i
do
and
their
experience
is
so
much
greater
than
mine
that
i
need
your
help
robert
and
the
hunter
assented
gladly
robert
in
truth
was
very
curious
to
hear
what
these
old
friends
and
enemies
of
his
had
to
say
and
he
felt
a
thrill
when
the
two
recognized
and
saluted
him
in
the
most
friendly
fashion
just
as
if
they
had
never
meant
him
any
harm
chance
brings
about
strange
meetings
between
us
mr
lennox
said
de
courcelles
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
note
that
you
have
not
yet
taken
any
personal
harm
from
our
siege
nor
you
nor
monsieur
de
jumonville
from
our
successful
defense
replied
robert
in
the
same
spirit
you
have
us
there
the
points
so
far
are
in
your
favor
although
only
superficially
so
as
i
shall
make
clear
to
you
presently
then
de
courcelles
turned
his
attention
to
colden
who
he
saw
was
the
nominal
leader
of
the
garrison
my
name
he
said
is
auguste
de
courcelles
a
colonel
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
king
louis
of
france
my
friend
is
captain
francois
de
jumonville
and
we
have
the
honor
to
lead
the
numerous
and
powerful
force
of
french
and
indians
now
besieging
you
and
my
name
is
colden
captain
james
colden
replied
the
young
officer
ive
heard
of
you
from
my
friends
mr
lennox
and
mr
willet
and
i
have
the
honor
of
asking
you
what
i
can
do
for
you
you
cannot
do
for
us
more
than
you
can
do
for
yourself
captain
colden
we
ask
the
surrender
of
your
little
fort
and
of
your
little
garrison
which
we
freely
admit
has
defended
itself
most
gallantly
its
not
necessary
for
us
to
make
an
assault
youre
deep
in
the
wilderness
we
can
hold
you
here
all
winter
and
help
cannot
possibly
come
to
you
we
guarantee
you
good
treatment
in
canada
where
you
will
be
held
until
the
war
is
over
young
colden
smiled
they
were
standing
before
the
single
gate
in
the
palisade
and
he
looked
back
at
the
solid
buildings
erected
by
the
hands
of
his
own
men
with
the
comfortable
smoke
curling
up
against
the
cold
sky
and
he
looked
also
at
the
wintry
forest
that
curved
in
every
direction
colonel
de
courcelles
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
in
and
you
are
out
if
it
comes
to
holding
us
here
all
winter
we
who
have
good
houses
can
stand
it
much
better
than
you
who
merely
have
the
forest
as
a
home
where
you
will
be
rained
upon
snowed
upon
hailed
upon
and
maybe
frozen
why
should
we
exchange
our
warm
house
for
your
cold
forest
colonel
de
courcelles
frowned
there
was
a
humorous
inflection
in
coldens
tone
that
did
not
please
him
and
the
young
officers
words
also
had
a
strong
element
of
truth
its
not
a
time
to
talk
about
houses
and
forests
he
said
somewhat
haughtily
we
have
here
a
formidable
force
capable
of
carrying
your
fort
and
for
that
reason
we
demand
your
surrender
indians
are
always
inflamed
by
a
long
and
desperate
resistance
and
while
captain
de
jumonville
and
i
will
do
our
best
to
restrain
them
its
possible
that
they
may
escape
from
our
control
in
the
hour
of
victory
young
colden
smiled
again
with
willet
at
his
right
hand
and
robert
at
his
left
he
acquired
lightness
of
spirit
a
demand
and
a
threat
together
he
replied
for
the
threat
we
dont
care
we
dont
believe
youll
ever
see
that
hour
of
victory
in
which
you
cant
control
your
indians
and
therell
be
no
need
for
you
colonel
de
courcelles
to
apologize
for
a
massacre
committed
by
your
allies
and
which
you
couldnt
help
were
also
growing
used
to
requests
of
surrender
there
was
your
countryman
st
luc
a
very
brave
and
skillful
man
who
asked
it
of
us
but
we
declined
and
in
the
end
we
defeated
him
and
if
we
beat
st
luc
without
the
aid
of
a
strong
fort
why
shouldnt
we
beat
you
with
it
colonel
de
courcelles
colonel
de
courcelles
frowned
once
more
and
captain
de
jumonville
frowned
with
him
you
dont
know
the
wilderness
captain
colden
he
said
and
you
dont
give
our
demand
the
serious
consideration
to
which
it
is
entitled
later
on
the
truth
of
what
i
tell
you
may
bear
heavily
upon
you
i
may
not
know
the
forest
as
you
do
colonel
de
courcelles
but
i
have
with
me
masters
of
woodcraft
mr
lennox
and
mr
willet
with
whom
youre
already
acquainted
weve
had
passages
of
various
kinds
with
colonel
de
courcelles
both
in
the
forest
and
at
quebec
said
robert
quietly
both
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
flushed
and
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
anxious
to
end
the
interview
this
i
take
it
is
your
final
answer
the
french
colonel
said
to
the
young
philadelphia
captain
it
is
sir
then
what
may
occur
rests
upon
the
knees
of
the
gods
it
does
sir
and
im
as
willing
as
you
to
abide
by
the
result
and
i
have
the
honor
of
bidding
you
good
day
an
equally
great
honor
is
mine
the
two
french
officers
were
ceremonious
they
lifted
their
fine
threecornered
hats
and
bowed
politely
and
colden
willet
and
robert
were
not
inferior
in
courtesy
then
the
frenchmen
walked
away
into
the
forest
while
the
three
americans
went
inside
the
palisade
where
the
heavy
gate
was
quickly
shut
behind
them
and
fastened
securely
but
before
he
turned
back
robert
thought
he
saw
the
huge
figure
of
tandakora
in
the
forest
when
the
french
officers
disappeared
several
shots
were
fired
and
the
savages
uttered
a
long
and
menacing
war
whoop
but
the
young
soldiers
had
grown
used
to
such
manifestations
and
instead
of
being
frightened
they
felt
a
certain
defiant
pleasure
yells
dont
hurt
us
said
wilton
to
robert
instead
i
feel
my
quaker
blood
rising
in
anger
and
id
rejoice
if
they
were
to
attack
now
a
very
heavy
responsibility
rests
upon
me
robert
since
ive
to
fight
not
only
for
myself
but
for
my
ancestors
who
wouldnt
fight
at
all
it
rests
upon
me
one
humble
youth
to
bring
up
the
warlike
average
of
the
family
youre
one
will
but
youre
not
humble
laughed
robert
i
believe
that
jest
of
yours
about
the
still
blood
of
generations
bursting
forth
in
you
at
last
is
not
a
jest
wholly
when
it
comes
to
a
pitched
battle
i
expect
to
see
you
perform
prodigies
of
valor
if
i
do
it
wont
be
will
wilton
myself
and
i
wont
be
entitled
to
any
credit
ill
be
merely
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
fate
working
out
the
law
of
averages
but
what
do
you
think
those
french
officers
and
their
savage
allies
will
do
now
robert
since
colden
so
to
speak
has
thrown
a
very
hard
glove
in
their
faces
draw
the
lines
tighter
about
fort
refuge
its
cold
in
the
forest
but
they
can
live
there
for
a
while
at
least
theyll
build
fires
and
throw
up
a
few
tepees
maybe
for
the
french
but
their
anger
and
their
desire
to
take
us
will
make
them
watch
all
the
more
closely
theyll
draw
tight
lines
around
this
snug
little
strong
little
fort
of
ours
which
removes
all
possibility
that
your
friend
tayoga
will
come
at
the
appointed
time
robert
glared
at
him
will
he
said
ive
discovered
that
you
have
a
double
nature
although
the
two
are
never
struggling
for
you
at
the
same
time
that
is
i
march
tandem
with
my
two
natures
so
to
speak
they
alternate
at
times
youre
a
sensible
boy
boy
im
older
than
you
are
one
wouldnt
think
it
but
a
well
bred
quaker
never
interrupts
as
i
said
youre
quite
sensible
at
times
and
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
saying
so
at
other
times
your
mind
loves
folly
it
fairly
swims
and
dives
in
the
foolish
pool
and
it
dives
deepest
when
youre
talking
about
tayoga
i
trust
foolish
young
sir
that
ive
heard
the
last
word
of
folly
from
you
about
the
arrival
of
tayoga
or
rather
what
you
conceive
will
be
his
failure
to
arrive
peace
not
a
word
at
least
let
me
say
this
protested
wilton
i
wish
that
i
could
feel
the
absolute
confidence
in
any
human
being
that
you
so
obviously
have
in
the
onondaga
the
night
came
white
and
beautiful
it
was
white
because
the
milky
way
was
at
its
brightest
which
was
uncommonly
bright
and
every
star
that
ever
showed
itself
in
that
latitude
came
out
and
danced
the
heavens
were
full
of
them
disporting
themselves
in
clusters
on
spangled
seas
and
the
forest
was
all
in
light
paler
than
that
of
day
but
almost
as
vivid
the
indians
lighted
several
fires
well
beyond
rifle
shot
and
the
sentinels
on
the
palisade
distinctly
saw
their
figures
passing
back
and
forth
before
the
blaze
robert
also
noticed
the
uniforms
of
frenchmen
and
he
thought
it
likely
that
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
had
with
them
more
soldiers
than
he
had
supposed
at
first
the
fires
burned
at
different
points
of
the
compass
and
thus
the
fort
was
encircled
completely
by
them
both
young
lennox
and
willet
knew
they
had
been
lighted
that
way
purposely
that
is
in
order
to
show
to
the
defenders
that
a
belt
of
fire
and
steel
was
drawn
close
about
them
to
wilton
at
least
the
indian
circle
seemed
impassable
and
despite
the
enormous
confidence
of
robert
he
now
had
none
at
all
himself
it
was
impossible
for
tayoga
even
if
he
had
triumphed
over
sleet
and
snow
and
flood
and
storm
to
pass
so
close
a
siege
he
would
not
speak
of
it
again
but
robert
had
allowed
himself
to
be
deluded
by
friendship
he
felt
sorry
for
his
new
friend
and
he
did
not
wish
to
see
his
disappointment
on
the
morrow
wilton
was
in
charge
of
the
guard
until
midnight
and
then
he
slept
soundly
until
dawn
awakening
to
a
brilliant
day
the
fit
successor
of
such
a
brilliant
night
the
indian
fires
were
still
burning
and
he
could
see
the
warriors
beside
them
sleeping
or
eating
at
leisure
they
still
formed
a
complete
circle
about
the
fort
and
while
the
young
quaker
felt
safe
inside
the
palisade
he
saw
no
chance
for
a
friend
outside
robert
joined
him
presently
but
respecting
his
feelings
the
philadelphian
said
nothing
about
tayoga
the
winter
it
seemed
was
exerting
itself
to
show
how
fine
a
day
it
could
produce
it
was
cold
but
dazzling
a
gorgeous
sun
all
red
and
gold
was
rising
and
the
light
was
so
vivid
and
intense
that
they
could
see
far
in
the
forest
bare
of
leaf
robert
clearly
discerned
both
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
about
six
hundred
yards
away
standing
by
one
of
the
fires
then
he
saw
the
gigantic
figure
of
tandakora
as
the
ojibway
joined
them
despite
the
cold
tandakora
wore
little
but
the
breechcloth
and
his
mighty
chest
and
shoulders
were
painted
with
many
hideous
devices
in
the
distance
and
in
the
glow
of
the
flames
his
size
was
exaggerated
until
he
looked
like
one
of
the
giants
of
ancient
mythology
robert
was
quite
sure
the
siege
would
never
be
raised
if
the
voice
of
the
ojibway
prevailed
in
the
allied
french
and
indian
councils
tandakora
had
been
wounded
twice
once
by
the
hunter
and
once
by
the
onondaga
and
a
mind
already
inflamed
against
the
americans
and
the
hodenosaunee
cherished
a
bitter
personal
hate
robert
knew
that
willet
tayoga
and
he
must
be
eternally
on
guard
against
his
murderous
attacks
the
savages
built
their
fires
higher
as
if
in
defiance
and
triumph
they
could
defend
themselves
against
cold
because
the
forest
furnished
unending
fuel
but
rain
or
hail
sleet
or
snow
would
bring
severe
hardship
the
day
however
favored
them
to
the
utmost
it
had
seemed
at
dawn
that
it
could
not
be
more
brilliant
but
as
the
morning
advanced
the
world
fairly
glowed
with
color
the
sky
was
golden
save
in
the
east
where
it
burned
in
red
and
the
trunks
and
black
boughs
of
the
forest
to
the
last
and
least
little
twig
were
touched
with
it
until
they
too
were
clothed
in
a
luminous
glow
the
besiegers
seemed
lazy
but
robert
knew
that
the
watch
upon
the
fort
and
its
approaches
was
never
neglected
for
an
instant
a
fox
could
not
steal
through
their
lines
unseen
and
yet
he
never
doubted
tayoga
would
come
and
moreover
he
would
come
at
the
time
appointed
toward
the
middle
of
the
morning
the
indians
shot
some
arrows
that
fell
inside
the
palisade
and
uttered
a
shout
or
two
of
defiance
but
nobody
was
hurt
and
nobody
was
stirred
to
action
the
demonstration
passed
unanswered
and
after
a
while
wilton
called
roberts
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
only
two
hours
until
noon
robert
did
not
reply
but
he
knew
that
the
conditions
could
not
be
more
unfavorable
rain
or
hail
sleet
or
snow
might
cover
the
passage
of
a
warrior
but
the
dazzling
sunlight
that
enlarged
twigs
two
hundred
yards
away
into
boughs
seemed
to
make
all
such
efforts
vain
yet
he
knew
tayoga
and
he
still
believed
soon
a
stir
came
in
the
forest
and
they
heard
a
long
droning
chant
a
dozen
warriors
appeared
coming
out
of
the
north
and
they
were
welcomed
with
shouts
by
the
others
hurons
i
think
said
willet
yes
im
sure
of
it
theyve
undoubtedly
sent
away
for
help
and
its
probable
that
other
bands
will
come
about
this
time
he
reckoned
right
as
in
half
an
hour
a
detachment
of
abenakis
came
and
they
too
were
received
with
approving
shouts
after
which
food
was
given
to
them
and
they
sat
luxuriously
before
the
fires
then
three
runners
arrived
one
from
the
north
one
from
the
west
and
one
from
the
east
and
a
great
shout
of
welcome
was
uttered
for
each
what
does
it
mean
wilton
asked
robert
the
runners
were
sent
out
by
de
courcelles
and
tandakora
to
rally
more
strength
for
our
siege
theyve
returned
with
the
news
that
fresh
forces
are
coming
as
the
exultant
shout
from
the
warriors
proves
the
young
philadelphians
heart
sank
he
knew
that
it
was
only
a
half
hour
until
noon
and
noon
was
the
appointed
time
nor
did
the
heavens
give
any
favoring
sign
the
whole
mighty
vault
was
a
blaze
of
gold
and
blue
nothing
could
stir
in
such
a
light
and
remain
hidden
from
the
warriors
wilton
looked
at
his
comrade
and
he
caught
a
sudden
glitter
in
his
eyes
it
was
not
the
look
of
one
who
despaired
instead
it
was
a
flash
of
triumph
and
the
young
philadelphian
wondered
had
robert
seen
a
sign
a
sign
that
had
escaped
all
others
he
searched
the
forest
everywhere
with
his
own
eyes
but
he
could
detect
nothing
unusual
there
were
the
french
and
there
were
the
indians
there
were
the
new
warriors
and
there
were
the
three
runners
resting
by
the
fires
the
runners
rose
presently
and
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
north
talked
with
tandakora
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
west
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
forest
with
an
abenaki
chief
and
looked
at
the
fort
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
east
joined
de
courcelles
himself
and
they
came
nearer
to
the
fort
than
any
of
the
others
although
they
remained
just
beyond
rifle
shot
evidently
de
courcelles
was
explaining
something
to
the
indian
as
once
he
pointed
toward
the
blockhouse
wilton
heard
robert
beside
him
draw
a
deep
breath
and
he
turned
in
surprise
the
face
of
young
lennox
was
tense
and
his
eyes
fairly
blazed
as
he
gazed
at
de
courcelles
and
the
warrior
then
looking
back
at
the
forest
robert
uttered
a
sudden
sharp
ah
the
release
of
uncontrollable
emotion
snapping
like
a
pistol
shot
did
you
see
it
will
did
you
see
it
he
exclaimed
it
was
quicker
than
lightning
the
indian
runner
stooped
snatched
the
pistol
from
the
belt
of
de
courcelles
struck
him
such
a
heavy
blow
on
the
head
with
the
butt
of
it
that
he
fell
without
a
sound
and
then
his
brown
body
shot
forward
like
an
arrow
for
the
fort
open
the
gate
open
the
gate
thundered
willet
and
strong
arms
unbarred
it
and
flung
it
back
in
an
instant
the
brown
body
of
tayoga
flashed
through
and
in
another
instant
it
was
closed
and
barred
again
he
is
here
with
five
minutes
to
spare
said
robert
as
he
left
the
palisade
with
wilton
and
went
toward
the
blockhouse
to
greet
his
friend
tayoga
painted
like
a
micmac
and
stooping
somewhat
hitherto
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
held
out
his
hand
in
the
white
mans
fashion
to
robert
while
his
eyes
usually
so
calm
showed
a
passing
gleam
of
triumph
i
said
tayoga
that
you
would
be
back
on
time
that
is
by
noon
today
said
robert
and
though
the
task
has
been
hard
youre
with
us
and
you
have
a
few
minutes
to
spare
how
did
you
deceive
the
sharp
eyes
of
tandakora
i
did
not
let
him
see
me
knowing
he
would
look
through
my
disguise
but
i
asked
the
french
colonel
to
come
forward
with
me
at
once
and
inspect
the
fort
knowing
that
it
was
my
only
chance
to
enter
here
and
he
agreed
to
do
so
you
saw
the
rest
and
thus
i
have
come
it
is
not
pleasant
to
those
who
besiege
us
as
your
ears
tell
you
fierce
yells
of
anger
and
disappointment
were
rising
in
the
forest
jumonville
and
two
french
soldiers
had
rushed
forward
seized
the
reviving
de
courcelles
and
were
carrying
him
to
one
of
the
fires
where
they
would
bind
up
his
injured
head
but
inside
the
fort
there
was
only
exultation
at
the
arrival
of
tayoga
and
admiration
for
his
skill
he
insisted
first
on
being
allowed
to
wash
off
the
micmac
paint
enabling
him
to
return
to
his
true
character
then
he
took
food
and
drink
tayoga
said
wilton
i
believed
you
could
not
come
i
said
so
often
to
lennox
you
would
never
have
known
my
belief
because
lennox
would
not
have
told
it
to
you
but
i
feel
that
i
must
apologize
to
you
for
the
thought
i
underrated
you
but
i
underrated
you
because
i
did
not
believe
any
human
being
could
do
what
you
have
done
tayoga
smiled
showing
his
splendid
white
teeth
your
thoughts
did
me
no
wrong
he
said
in
his
precise
school
english
because
the
elements
and
chance
itself
seemed
to
have
conspired
against
me
later
he
told
what
he
had
heard
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
where
the
sachems
and
chiefs
kept
themselves
well
informed
concerning
the
movements
of
the
belligerent
nations
the
french
were
still
the
more
active
of
the
rival
powers
and
their
energy
and
conquests
were
bringing
the
western
tribes
in
great
numbers
to
their
flag
throughout
the
ohio
country
the
warriors
were
on
the
side
of
the
french
who
were
continuing
the
construction
of
the
powerful
fortress
at
the
junction
of
the
alleghany
and
the
monongahela
the
french
were
far
down
in
the
province
of
new
york
and
they
held
control
of
lake
champlain
and
of
lake
george
also
more
settlements
had
been
cut
off
and
more
women
and
children
had
been
taken
prisoners
into
canada
but
the
british
colonies
and
great
britain
too
would
move
so
tayoga
said
they
were
slow
much
slower
than
canada
but
they
had
the
greater
strength
and
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
knew
it
they
could
not
be
moved
from
their
attitude
of
friendliness
toward
the
english
and
the
mohawks
openly
espoused
the
english
side
the
american
franklin
was
very
active
and
a
great
movement
against
fort
duquesne
would
be
begun
although
it
might
not
start
until
next
spring
an
english
force
under
an
english
general
was
coming
across
the
sea
and
the
might
of
england
was
gathering
for
a
great
blow
the
onondaga
had
few
changes
in
the
situation
to
report
but
he
at
least
brought
news
of
the
outside
world
driving
away
from
the
young
soldiers
the
feeling
that
they
were
cut
off
from
the
human
race
wilton
was
present
when
he
was
telling
of
these
things
and
when
he
had
finished
robert
asked
how
did
you
make
your
way
through
the
great
snow
tayoga
it
is
well
to
think
long
before
of
difficulties
he
replied
last
year
when
the
winter
was
finished
i
hid
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
in
this
part
of
the
forest
and
when
the
deep
snow
came
i
found
them
and
used
them
robert
glanced
at
wilton
whose
eyes
were
widening
and
the
great
rain
and
flood
how
did
you
meet
that
obstacle
asked
robert
that
too
was
forethought
i
have
two
canoes
hidden
in
this
region
and
it
was
easy
to
reach
one
of
them
in
which
i
traveled
with
speed
and
comfort
until
i
could
use
it
no
longer
then
i
hid
it
away
again
that
it
might
help
me
another
time
and
what
did
you
do
when
the
hurricane
came
tearing
up
the
bushes
cutting
down
the
trees
and
making
the
forest
as
dangerous
as
if
it
were
being
showered
by
cannon
balls
i
crept
under
a
wide
ledge
of
stone
in
the
side
of
a
hill
where
i
lay
snug
dry
and
safe
wilton
looked
at
tayoga
and
robert
and
then
back
at
the
onondaga
is
this
wizardry
he
cried
no
replied
robert
then
its
singular
chance
nor
that
either
it
was
the
necessities
that
confronted
tayoga
in
the
face
of
varied
dangers
and
my
knowledge
of
what
he
would
be
likely
to
do
in
either
case
merely
a
rather
fortunate
use
of
the
reasoning
faculties
will
willet
who
had
come
in
smiled
dont
let
em
make
game
of
you
mr
wilton
he
said
but
theres
truth
in
what
robert
tells
you
he
understands
tayoga
so
thoroughly
that
he
knows
pretty
well
what
hell
do
in
every
crisis
after
the
onondaga
had
eaten
he
wrapped
himself
in
blankets
went
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
blockhouse
and
slept
twentyfour
hours
when
he
awoke
he
showed
no
signs
of
his
tremendous
journey
and
infinite
dangers
he
was
once
more
the
lithe
and
powerful
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
besiegers
meanwhile
undertook
no
movement
but
as
if
in
defiance
they
increased
the
fires
in
the
red
ring
around
the
fort
and
they
showed
themselves
ostentatiously
robert
several
times
saw
de
courcelles
with
a
thick
bandage
about
his
head
and
he
knew
that
the
frenchmans
mortification
and
rage
at
being
tricked
so
by
the
onondaga
must
be
intense
now
the
weather
began
to
grow
very
cold
again
and
robert
saw
the
number
of
tepees
in
the
forest
increase
the
indians
not
content
with
the
fires
were
providing
themselves
with
good
shelters
and
to
every
one
it
indicated
a
long
siege
there
was
neither
snow
nor
hail
but
clear
bitter
intense
cold
and
again
the
timbers
of
the
blockhouse
and
outbuildings
popped
as
they
contracted
under
the
lower
temperature
the
horses
were
pretty
well
sheltered
from
the
cold
and
willet
with
his
usual
foresight
had
suggested
before
the
siege
closed
in
that
a
great
deal
of
grass
be
cut
for
them
though
should
the
french
and
indians
hang
on
for
a
month
or
two
they
would
certainly
become
a
problem
food
for
the
men
would
last
indefinitely
but
a
time
might
arrive
when
none
would
be
left
for
the
horses
if
the
pinch
comes
said
willet
we
know
how
to
relieve
it
how
asked
colden
well
eat
the
horses
colden
made
a
wry
face
its
often
been
done
in
europe
said
the
hunter
at
the
famous
sieges
of
leyden
and
haarlem
when
the
dutch
held
out
so
long
against
the
spanish
theyd
have
been
glad
enough
to
have
had
horseflesh
i
look
ahead
again
said
robert
hiding
a
humorous
gleam
in
his
eyes
from
colden
and
i
see
a
number
of
young
men
behind
a
palisade
which
they
have
held
gallantly
for
months
they
come
mostly
from
philadelphia
and
they
call
themselves
quakers
they
are
thin
awfully
thin
terribly
thin
so
thin
that
there
is
scarcely
enough
to
make
a
circle
for
their
belts
they
have
not
eaten
for
four
days
and
they
are
about
to
kill
their
last
horse
when
he
is
gone
they
will
have
to
live
on
fresh
air
and
scenery
now
i
know
lennox
that
youre
drawing
on
your
imagination
and
that
youre
a
false
prophet
said
colden
i
hope
my
prediction
wont
come
true
and
i
dont
believe
it
will
said
robert
cheerfully
several
nights
later
when
there
was
no
moon
and
no
stars
willet
and
tayoga
slipped
out
of
the
fort
colden
was
much
opposed
to
their
going
fearing
for
their
lives
and
knowing
too
how
great
a
loss
they
would
be
if
they
were
taken
or
slain
but
the
hunter
and
the
