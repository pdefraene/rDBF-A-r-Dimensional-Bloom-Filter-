chapter
i
the
onondaga
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
advanced
with
utmost
caution
through
a
forest
so
thick
with
undergrowth
that
it
hid
all
objects
twenty
yards
away
he
was
not
armed
with
a
rifle
but
carried
instead
a
heavy
bow
while
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
hung
over
his
shoulder
he
wore
less
clothing
than
when
he
was
in
the
white
mans
school
at
albany
his
arms
and
shoulders
being
bare
though
not
painted
the
young
indians
aspect
too
had
changed
the
great
struggle
between
english
and
french
drawing
with
it
the
whole
north
american
wilderness
had
begun
and
although
the
fifty
sachems
still
sought
to
hold
the
six
nations
neutral
many
of
their
bravest
warriors
were
already
serving
with
the
americans
and
english
ranging
the
forest
as
scouts
and
guides
and
skirmishers
bringing
to
the
campaign
an
unrivaled
skill
and
a
faith
sealed
by
the
long
alliance
tayoga
had
thrown
himself
into
the
war
heart
and
soul
nothing
could
diminish
by
a
hair
his
hostility
to
the
french
and
the
tribes
allied
with
them
the
deeds
of
champlain
and
frontenac
were
but
of
yesterday
and
the
nation
to
which
they
belonged
could
never
be
a
friend
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
trusted
the
americans
and
the
english
but
his
chief
devotion
by
the
decree
of
nature
was
for
his
own
people
and
now
that
fighting
in
the
forest
had
occurred
between
the
rival
nations
he
shed
more
of
the
white
ways
and
became
a
true
son
of
the
wilderness
seeing
as
red
men
saw
and
thinking
as
red
men
thought
he
was
bent
over
a
little
as
he
walked
slowly
among
the
bushes
in
the
position
of
one
poised
for
instant
flight
or
pursuit
as
the
need
might
be
his
eyes
black
and
piercing
ranged
about
incessantly
nothing
escaping
a
vision
so
keen
and
trained
so
thoroughly
that
he
not
only
heard
everything
passing
in
the
wilderness
but
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
sound
and
what
had
made
it
the
kindly
look
that
distinguished
tayoga
in
repose
had
disappeared
unnumbered
generations
were
speaking
in
him
now
and
the
indian
often
so
gentle
in
peace
had
become
his
usual
self
stern
and
unrelenting
in
war
his
strong
sharp
chin
was
thrust
forward
his
cheek
bones
seemed
to
be
a
little
higher
his
tread
was
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
bent
before
his
moccasins
and
no
leaves
rustled
he
was
in
every
respect
the
wilderness
hunter
and
warrior
fitted
perfectly
by
the
supreme
hand
into
his
setting
and
if
an
enemy
appeared
now
he
would
fight
as
his
people
had
fought
for
centuries
and
the
customs
and
feelings
of
the
new
races
that
had
come
across
the
ocean
would
be
nothing
to
him
a
hundred
yards
more
and
he
sat
down
by
the
trunk
of
a
great
oak
convinced
that
no
foe
was
near
his
own
five
splendid
senses
had
told
him
so
and
the
fact
had
been
confirmed
by
an
unrivaled
sentinel
hidden
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
a
small
bird
that
poured
forth
a
wonderful
volume
of
song
were
any
other
coming
the
bird
would
cease
his
melody
and
fly
away
but
tayoga
felt
that
this
tiny
feathered
being
was
his
ally
and
would
not
leave
because
of
him
the
song
had
wonderful
power
too
soothing
his
senses
and
casting
a
pleasing
spell
his
imaginative
mind
infused
with
the
religion
and
beliefs
of
his
ancestors
filled
the
forest
with
friendly
spirits
unseen
they
hovered
in
the
air
and
watched
over
him
and
the
trees
alive
bent
protecting
boughs
toward
him
he
saw
too
the
very
spot
in
the
heavens
where
the
great
shining
star
on
which
tododaho
lived
came
out
at
night
and
glittered
he
remembered
the
time
when
he
had
gone
forth
in
the
dusk
to
meet
tandakora
and
his
friends
and
how
tododaho
had
looked
down
on
him
with
approval
he
had
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
the
great
leagues
founder
and
the
spirit
that
dwelt
on
the
shining
star
still
watched
over
him
the
ojibway
whom
he
hated
and
who
hated
him
in
yet
greater
measure
might
be
somewhere
in
the
forest
but
if
he
came
near
the
feathered
sentinel
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
would
give
warning
tayoga
sat
nearly
half
an
hour
listening
to
the
song
of
the
bird
he
had
no
object
in
remaining
there
his
errand
bade
him
move
on
but
there
was
no
hurry
and
he
was
content
merely
to
breathe
and
to
feel
the
glory
and
splendor
of
the
forest
about
him
he
knew
now
that
the
indian
nature
had
never
been
taken
out
of
him
by
the
schools
he
loved
the
wilderness
the
trees
the
lakes
the
streams
and
all
their
magnificent
disorder
and
war
itself
did
not
greatly
trouble
him
since
the
legends
of
the
tribes
made
it
the
natural
state
of
man
he
knew
well
that
he
was
in
tododahos
keeping
and
if
by
chance
the
great
chief
should
turn
against
him
it
would
be
for
some
grave
fault
and
he
would
deserve
his
punishment
he
sat
in
that
absolute
stillness
of
which
the
indian
by
nature
and
training
was
capable
the
green
of
his
tanned
and
beautifully
soft
deerskin
blending
so
perfectly
with
the
emerald
hue
of
the
foliage
that
the
bird
above
his
head
at
last
took
him
for
a
part
of
the
forest
itself
and
so
having
no
fear
came
down
within
a
foot
of
his
head
and
sang
with
more
ecstasy
than
ever
it
was
a
little
gray
bird
but
tayoga
knew
that
often
the
smaller
a
bird
was
and
the
more
sober
its
plumage
the
finer
was
its
song
he
understood
those
musical
notes
too
they
expressed
sheer
delight
the
joy
of
life
just
as
he
felt
it
then
himself
and
the
kinship
between
the
two
was
strong
the
bird
at
last
flew
away
and
the
onondaga
heard
its
song
dying
among
the
distant
leaves
a
portion
of
the
forest
spell
departed
with
it
and
tayoga
returning
to
thoughts
of
his
task
rose
and
walked
on
instinct
rather
than
will
causing
him
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
earth
and
foliage
when
he
saw
the
faint
trace
of
a
large
moccasin
on
the
earth
all
that
was
left
of
the
spell
departed
suddenly
and
he
became
at
once
the
wilderness
warrior
active
alert
ready
to
read
every
sign
he
studied
the
imprint
which
turned
in
and
hence
had
been
made
by
an
indian
its
great
size
too
indicated
to
him
that
it
might
be
that
of
tandakora
a
belief
becoming
with
him
almost
a
certainty
as
he
found
other
and
similar
traces
farther
on
he
followed
them
about
a
mile
reaching
stony
ground
where
they
vanished
altogether
and
then
he
turned
to
the
west
the
fact
that
tandakora
was
so
near
and
might
approach
again
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
as
tayoga
having
all
the
soul
of
a
warrior
was
anxious
to
match
himself
with
the
gigantic
ojibway
and
since
the
war
was
now
active
on
the
border
it
seemed
that
the
opportunity
might
come
but
his
attention
must
be
occupied
with
something
else
for
the
present
and
he
went
toward
the
west
for
a
full
hour
through
the
primeval
forest
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
listen
even
lying
down
and
putting
his
ear
to
the
ground
but
the
sounds
he
heard
although
varied
and
many
were
natural
to
the
wild
he
knew
them
all
the
steady
tapping
was
a
woodpecker
at
work
upon
an
old
tree
the
faint
musical
note
was
another
little
gray
bird
singing
the
delight
of
his
soul
as
he
perched
himself
upon
a
twig
the
light
shuffling
noise
was
the
tread
of
a
bear
hunting
succulent
nuts
a
cawcaw
so
distant
that
it
was
like
an
echo
was
the
voice
of
a
circling
crow
and
the
tiny
trickling
noise
that
only
the
keenest
ear
could
have
heard
was
made
by
a
brook
a
yard
wide
taking
a
terrific
plunge
over
a
precipice
six
inches
high
the
rustling
one
great
blended
note
universal
but
soft
was
that
of
the
leaves
moving
in
harmony
before
the
gentle
wind
the
young
onondaga
was
sure
that
the
forest
held
no
alien
presence
the
traces
of
tandakora
were
hours
old
and
he
must
now
be
many
miles
away
with
his
band
and
such
being
the
case
it
was
fit
time
for
him
to
choose
a
camp
and
call
his
friends
it
pleased
tayoga
zealous
of
mind
to
do
all
the
work
before
the
others
came
and
treading
so
lightly
and
delicately
that
he
would
not
have
alarmed
a
rabbit
in
the
bush
he
gathered
together
dead
sticks
and
heaped
them
in
a
little
sunken
place
clear
of
undergrowth
flint
and
steel
soon
lighted
a
fire
and
then
he
sent
forth
his
call
the
long
penetrating
whine
of
the
wolf
the
reply
came
from
the
north
and
building
his
fire
a
little
higher
he
awaited
the
result
without
anxiety
the
dry
wood
crackled
and
many
little
flames
red
or
yellow
arose
tayoga
heaped
dead
leaves
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
sat
down
comfortably
his
shoulders
and
back
resting
against
the
bark
presently
he
heard
the
first
alien
sound
in
the
forest
a
light
tread
approaching
that
he
knew
was
willet
and
then
he
heard
the
second
tread
even
lighter
than
the
first
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
footstep
of
robert
all
ready
its
like
you
tayoga
said
willet
as
he
entered
the
open
space
here
you
are
with
the
house
built
and
the
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
i
lighted
the
fire
said
tayoga
rising
but
manitou
made
the
hearth
and
built
the
house
which
is
worthy
of
him
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
magnificent
trees
spreading
away
on
every
side
and
the
foliage
in
its
most
splendid
new
luxuriant
green
it
is
worthy
tayoga
said
robert
whose
soul
was
like
that
of
the
onondaga
and
it
takes
manitou
himself
a
century
or
more
to
grow
trees
like
these
some
of
them
i
dare
say
are
three
or
four
hundred
years
old
or
more
said
willet
and
the
forest
goes
west
so
ive
heard
the
indians
say
a
matter
of
near
two
thousand
miles
its
pleasant
to
know
that
if
all
the
axes
in
the
world
were
at
work
it
couldnt
all
be
cut
down
in
our
time
or
in
the
time
of
our
children
tayogas
heart
swelled
with
indignation
at
the
idea
that
the
forest
might
be
destroyed
but
he
said
nothing
as
he
knew
that
willet
and
robert
shared
his
feeling
heres
your
rifle
tayoga
said
the
hunter
i
suppose
you
didnt
have
an
occasion
to
use
your
bow
and
arrows
no
great
bear
replied
the
onondaga
but
i
might
have
had
the
chance
had
i
come
earlier
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
saw
on
the
grass
a
human
trace
it
was
made
by
a
foot
clothed
in
a
moccasin
a
large
foot
a
very
large
foot
the
foot
of
a
man
whom
we
all
have
cause
to
hate
i
take
it
youre
speaking
of
tandakora
the
ojibway
none
other
i
cannot
be
mistaken
but
the
trail
was
cold
he
and
his
warriors
have
gone
north
they
may
be
thirty
forty
miles
from
here
likely
enough
tayoga
theyre
on
their
way
to
join
the
force
the
french
are
sending
to
the
fort
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
and
the
alleghany
perhaps
st
lucand
there
isnt
a
cleverer
officer
in
this
continentis
with
them
i
tell
you
tayoga
and
you
too
robert
i
dont
like
it
that
young
washington
ought
to
have
been
sent
earlier
into
the
ohio
country
and
they
should
have
given
him
a
much
larger
force
were
sluggards
and
all
our
governors
are
sluggards
except
maybe
shirley
of
massachusetts
with
the
war
just
blazing
up
the
french
are
already
in
possession
and
were
to
drive
em
out
which
doubles
our
task
it
was
a
great
victory
for
us
to
keep
the
hodenosaunee
on
our
side
or
in
the
main
neutral
but
its
going
to
be
uphill
work
for
us
to
win
the
young
french
leaders
are
genuine
kings
of
the
wilderness
you
know
that
robert
as
well
as
i
do
yes
said
the
youth
i
know
theyre
the
men
whom
the
english
colonies
have
good
cause
to
fear
when
he
spoke
he
was
thinking
of
st
luc
as
he
had
last
seen
him
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
defeated
in
the
appeal
to
the
fifty
sachems
but
gallant
well
bred
showing
nothing
of
chagrin
and
sure
to
be
a
formidable
foe
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
an
enemy
of
whom
one
could
be
proud
and
robert
felt
an
actual
wish
to
see
him
again
even
though
in
opposing
ranks
we
may
come
into
contact
with
some
of
em
said
the
hunter
the
french
are
using
all
their
influence
over
the
indians
and
are
directing
their
movements
i
know
that
st
luc
jumonville
beaujeu
dumas
de
villiers
de
courcelles
and
all
their
best
men
are
in
the
forest
its
likely
that
tandakora
fierce
and
wild
as
he
is
is
acting
under
the
direction
of
some
frenchman
st
luc
could
control
him
robert
thought
it
highly
probable
that
the
chevalier
was
in
truth
with
the
indians
on
the
border
either
leading
some
daring
band
or
gathering
the
warriors
to
the
banner
of
france
his
influence
with
them
would
be
great
as
he
understood
their
ways
adapted
himself
to
them
and
showed
in
battle
a
skill
and
daring
that
always
make
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
savage
heart
the
youth
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
in
the
test
of
words
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
now
he
felt
that
he
must
match
himself
anew
but
in
the
test
of
forest
war
tayoga
having
lighted
the
fire
the
hunter
cooked
the
food
over
it
while
the
two
youths
reposed
calmly
robert
watched
willet
with
interest
and
he
was
impressed
for
the
thousandth
time
by
his
great
strength
and
the
lightness
of
his
movements
when
he
was
younger
the
disparity
in
years
had
made
him
think
of
willet
as
an
old
man
but
he
saw
now
that
he
was
only
in
early
middle
age
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
on
his
head
and
his
face
was
free
from
wrinkles
an
extraordinarily
vivid
memory
of
that
night
in
quebec
when
the
hunter
had
faced
boucher
the
bully
and
bravo
reputed
the
best
swordsman
of
france
leaped
up
in
roberts
mind
he
had
found
no
time
to
think
of
willets
past
recently
and
he
realized
now
that
he
knew
little
about
it
the
origin
of
that
hunter
was
as
obscure
as
his
own
but
the
story
of
the
past
and
its
mysteries
must
wait
the
present
was
so
great
and
overwhelming
that
it
blotted
out
everything
else
the
venison
and
the
bacon
are
ready
said
willet
and
you
two
lads
can
fall
on
youre
not
what
id
call
epicures
but
ive
never
known
your
appetites
to
fail
nor
will
they
said
robert
as
he
and
tayoga
helped
themselves
whats
the
news
from
britain
dave
you
must
have
heard
a
lot
when
you
were
in
albany
its
vague
robert
vague
the
english
are
slow
just
as
we
americans
are
too
theyre
going
to
send
out
troops
but
the
french
have
dispatched
a
fleet
and
regiments
already
the
fact
that
our
colonies
are
so
much
larger
than
theirs
is
perhaps
an
advantage
to
them
as
it
gives
them
a
bigger
target
to
aim
at
and
our
people
who
are
trying
to
till
their
farms
will
be
struck
down
by
their
indians
from
ambush
and
you
see
now
what
a
bulwark
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
is
to
the
english
said
tayoga
a
fact
that
ive
always
foreseen
said
willet
warmly
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
the
power
of
the
six
nations
and
nobody
has
ever
been
readier
to
admit
it
i
know
great
bear
you
have
always
been
our
true
friend
if
all
the
white
men
were
like
you
no
trouble
would
ever
arise
between
them
and
the
hodenosaunee
robert
finished
his
food
and
resumed
a
comfortable
place
against
a
tree
willet
put
out
the
fire
and
he
and
tayoga
sat
down
in
like
fashion
their
trees
were
close
together
but
they
did
not
talk
now
each
was
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
robert
had
much
to
think
about
the
war
was
going
slowly
he
had
believed
a
great
flare
would
come
at
once
and
that
everybody
would
soon
be
in
the
thick
of
action
but
since
young
washington
had
been
defeated
by
coulon
de
villiers
at
the
great
meadows
the
british
colonies
had
spent
much
time
debating
and
pulling
in
different
directions
the
union
for
which
his
eager
soul
craved
did
not
come
and
the
shadow
of
the
french
power
in
the
north
reinforced
by
innumerable
savages
hung
heavy
and
black
over
the
land
every
runner
brought
news
of
french
activities
rumor
painted
as
impregnable
the
fort
they
had
built
where
two
rivers
uniting
formed
the
ohio
and
it
was
certain
that
many
bands
already
ranged
down
in
the
regions
the
english
called
their
own
spring
had
lingered
far
into
summer
where
they
were
and
the
foliage
was
not
yet
touched
by
heat
all
the
forest
was
in
deep
and
heavy
green
hiding
every
object
a
hundred
yards
away
but
from
their
opening
they
saw
a
blue
and
speckless
sky
which
the
three
by
and
by
watched
attentively
and
with
the
same
motive
before
the
dark
had
begun
to
come
in
the
east
they
saw
a
thin
dark
line
drawn
slowly
across
it
the
trail
of
smoke
it
might
not
have
been
noticed
by
eyes
less
keen
but
they
understood
at
once
that
it
was
a
signal
robert
noted
its
drifting
progress
across
the
heavens
and
then
he
said
to
willet
how
far
from
here
do
you
calculate
the
base
of
that
smoke
is
dave
a
long
distance
robert
several
miles
maybe
the
fire
ive
no
doubt
was
kindled
on
top
of
a
hill
it
may
be
french
speaking
to
indians
or
indians
talking
to
indians
and
you
dont
think
its
people
of
ours
im
sure
it
isnt
weve
no
hunters
or
runners
in
these
parts
except
ourselves
and
its
not
tandakora
said
the
onondaga
he
must
be
much
farther
away
but
the
signal
may
be
intended
for
him
said
the
hunter
it
may
be
carried
to
him
by
relays
of
smoke
i
wish
i
could
read
that
trail
across
the
sky
its
thinning
out
fast
said
robert
you
can
hardly
see
it
and
now
its
gone
entirely
but
the
hunter
continued
to
look
thoughtfully
at
the
sky
where
the
smoke
had
been
he
never
underrated
the
activity
of
the
french
and
he
believed
that
a
movement
of
importance
something
the
nature
of
which
they
should
discover
was
at
hand
lads
he
said
i
expected
an
easy
night
of
good
sleep
for
all
three
of
us
but
im
thinking
instead
that
wed
better
take
to
the
trail
and
travel
toward
the
place
where
that
smoke
was
started
its
what
scouts
would
do
said
tayoga
tersely
and
such
we
claim
to
be
said
robert
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
they
saw
far
in
the
west
another
smoke
that
would
have
been
invisible
had
it
not
been
outlined
against
a
fiery
red
sky
across
which
it
lay
like
a
dark
thread
it
was
gone
in
a
few
moments
and
then
the
dusk
began
to
come
an
answer
to
the
first
signal
said
tayoga
it
is
very
likely
that
a
strong
force
is
gathering
perhaps
tandakora
has
come
back
and
is
planning
a
blow
it
cant
be
possible
that
theyre
aiming
it
at
us
said
the
hunter
thoughtfully
they
dont
know
of
our
presence
here
and
if
they
did
weve
too
small
a
party
for
such
big
preparations
perhaps
a
troop
of
pennsylvanians
are
marching
westward
said
tayoga
and
the
french
and
their
allies
are
laying
a
trap
for
them
then
said
robert
there
is
but
one
thing
for
us
to
do
we
must
warn
our
friends
and
save
them
from
the
snare
of
course
said
willet
but
we
dont
know
where
they
are
and
meanwhile
wed
better
wait
an
hour
or
two
perhaps
something
will
happen
that
will
help
us
to
locate
them
robert
and
tayoga
nodded
and
the
three
remained
silent
while
the
night
came
the
blazing
red
in
the
west
faded
rapidly
and
darkness
swept
down
over
the
wilderness
the
three
each
leaning
against
his
tree
did
not
move
but
kept
their
rifles
across
their
knees
ready
at
once
for
possible
use
tayoga
had
fastened
his
bow
over
his
back
by
the
side
of
his
quiver
and
their
packs
were
adjusted
also
robert
was
anxious
not
so
much
for
himself
as
for
the
unknown
others
who
were
marching
through
the
wilderness
and
for
whom
the
french
and
indians
were
laying
an
ambush
it
had
been
put
forward
first
as
a
suggestion
but
it
quickly
became
a
conviction
with
him
and
he
felt
that
his
comrades
and
he
must
act
as
if
it
were
a
certainty
but
no
sound
that
would
tell
them
which
way
to
go
came
out
of
this
black
forest
and
they
remained
silent
waiting
for
the
word
the
night
thickened
and
they
were
still
uncertain
what
to
do
robert
made
a
silent
prayer
to
the
god
of
the
white
man
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
for
a
sign
but
none
came
and
infected
strongly
as
he
was
with
the
indian
philosophy
and
religion
he
felt
that
it
must
be
due
to
some
lack
of
virtue
in
himself
he
searched
his
memory
but
he
could
not
discover
in
what
particular
he
had
erred
and
he
was
forced
to
continue
his
anxious
waiting
until
the
stars
should
choose
to
fight
for
him
tayoga
too
was
troubled
his
mind
in
its
own
way
being
as
active
as
roberts
he
knew
all
the
spirits
of
earth
air
and
water
were
abroad
but
he
hoped
at
least
one
of
them
would
look
upon
him
with
favor
and
give
him
a
warning
he
sought
tododahos
star
in
the
heavens
but
the
clouds
were
too
thick
and
eye
failing
he
relied
upon
his
ear
for
the
signal
which
he
and
his
young
white
comrade
sought
so
earnestly
if
tayoga
had
erred
either
in
omission
or
commission
then
the
spirits
that
hovered
about
him
forgave
him
as
when
the
night
was
thickest
they
gave
the
sign
it
was
but
the
faint
fall
of
a
foot
and
at
first
he
thought
a
bear
or
a
deer
had
made
it
but
at
the
fourth
or
fifth
fall
he
knew
that
it
was
a
human
footstep
and
he
whispered
to
his
comrades
some
one
comes
as
if
by
preconcerted
signal
the
three
arose
and
crept
silently
into
the
dense
underbrush
where
they
crouched
their
rifles
thrust
forward
it
is
but
one
man
and
he
walks
directly
toward
us
whispered
tayoga
i
hear
him
now
said
robert
he
is
wearing
moccasins
as
his
step
is
too
light
for
boots
which
means
that
hes
a
rover
like
ourselves
said
willet
now
hes
stopped
there
isnt
a
sound
the
man
whoever
he
is
has
taken
alarm
or
at
least
hes
decided
that
its
best
for
him
to
be
more
watchful
perhaps
hes
caught
a
whiff
from
the
ashes
of
our
fire
hes
white
or
he
wouldnt
be
here
alone
and
hes
used
to
the
forest
or
he
wouldnt
have
suspected
a
presence
from
so
little
the
great
bear
thinks
clearly
said
tayoga
it
is
surely
a
white
man
and
some
great
scout
or
hunter
he
moved
a
little
now
to
the
right
because
i
heard
his
buckskin
brush
lightly
against
a
bush
i
think
great
bear
is
right
about
the
fire
the
wind
has
brought
the
ashes
from
it
to
his
nostrils
and
he
will
lie
in
the
bush
long
before
moving
which
doesnt
suit
our
plans
at
all
said
willet
theres
a
chance
just
a
chance
that
i
may
know
who
he
is
white
men
of
the
kind
to
go
scouting
through
the
wilderness
are
not
so
plenty
on
the
border
that
one
has
to
make
many
guesses
you
lads
move
away
a
little
so
you
wont
be
in
line
if
a
shot
comes
and
ill
give
a
signal
robert
and
tayoga
crept
to
other
points
in
the
brush
and
the
hunter
uttered
a
whistle
low
but
very
clear
and
musical
in
a
moment
or
two
a
like
answer
came
from
a
place
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
willet
rising
advanced
without
hesitation
robert
and
tayoga
followed
promptly
and
a
tall
figure
emerging
from
the
darkness
came
forward
to
meet
them
the
stranger
was
a
man
of
middle
years
and
of
a
singularly
wild
appearance
his
eyes
roved
continually
and
were
full
of
suspicion
and
of
a
sort
of
smoldering
anger
as
if
he
had
a
grievance
against
all
the
world
his
hair
was
long
and
tangled
his
face
brown
with
sun
and
storm
and
his
dress
more
indian
than
white
he
was
heavily
armed
and
whether
seen
in
the
dusk
or
in
the
light
his
whole
aspect
was
formidable
and
dangerous
but
willet
continued
to
advance
without
hesitation
captain
jack
he
said
extending
his
hand
we
were
not
looking
for
you
tonight
but
no
man
could
be
more
welcome
these
are
young
friends
of
mine
brave
warriors
both
the
white
and
the
red
robert
lennox
who
is
almost
a
son
to
me
and
tayoga
the
onondaga
to
whom
i
feel
nearly
like
a
father
too
now
robert
knew
him
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
of
the
most
intense
curiosity
who
along
the
whole
border
had
not
heard
of
captain
jack
known
also
as
the
black
hunter
the
black
rifle
and
by
many
other
names
the
tale
had
been
told
in
every
cabin
in
the
woods
how
returning
home
he
had
found
his
wife
and
children
tomahawked
and
scalped
and
how
he
had
taken
a
vow
of
lifelong
vengeance
upon
the
indians
a
vow
most
terribly
kept
in
all
the
villages
in
the
ohio
country
and
along
the
great
lakes
the
name
of
black
rifle
was
spoken
with
awe
and
terror
no
more
singular
and
ominous
figure
ever
crossed
the
pages
of
border
story
he
swept
the
two
youths
with
questing
glances
but
they
met
his
gaze
firmly
and
while
his
eye
had
clouded
at
first
sight
of
the
onondaga
the
threatening
look
soon
passed
friends
of
yours
are
friends
of
mine
dave
willet
he
said
i
know
you
to
be
a
good
man
and
true
and
once
when
i
was
at
albany
i
heard
of
robert
lennox
and
of
the
great
young
warrior
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
young
onondagas
eyes
flashed
with
pleasure
but
he
was
silent
how
does
it
happen
willet
asked
black
rifle
that
we
meet
here
in
the
forest
at
such
a
time
were
on
our
way
to
the
ohio
country
to
learn
something
about
the
gathering
of
the
french
and
indian
forces
just
before
sundown
we
saw
smoke
signals
and
we
think
our
enemies
are
planning
to
cut
off
a
force
of
ours
somewhere
here
in
the
forest
black
rifle
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
laugh
it
had
in
it
a
quality
that
made
robert
shudder
your
guesses
are
good
dave
said
black
rifle
about
fifty
men
of
the
pennsylvania
militia
are
in
camp
on
the
banks
of
a
little
creek
two
miles
from
here
they
have
been
sent
out
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
think
of
that
dave
theyre
to
be
a
guard
against
the
french
and
indians
his
face
contracted
into
a
wry
smile
and
robert
understood
his
feeling
of
derision
for
the
militia
as
i
told
you
theyre
in
camp
continued
black
rifle
they
built
a
fire
there
to
cook
their
supper
and
to
show
the
french
and
indians
where
they
are
lest
they
miss
em
in
the
darkness
they
dont
know
what
part
of
the
country
theyre
in
but
theyre
sure
its
a
long
distance
west
of
philadelphia
and
if
the
indians
will
only
tell
em
when
theyre
coming
theyll
be
ready
for
em
oh
theyre
brave
enough
theyll
probably
all
die
with
their
faces
to
the
enemy
he
spoke
with
grim
irony
and
robert
shuddered
he
knew
how
helpless
men
from
the
older
parts
of
the
country
were
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
and
he
was
sure
that
the
net
was
already
being
drawn
about
the
pennsylvanians
are
the
french
here
too
black
rifle
asked
willet
the
strange
man
pointed
toward
the
north
a
band
led
by
a
frenchman
is
there
he
replied
he
is
the
most
skillful
of
all
their
men
in
the
forest
the
one
whom
they
call
st
luc
i
thought
so
exclaimed
robert
i
believed
all
the
while
he
would
be
here
ive
no
doubt
he
will
direct
the
ambush
we
must
warn
this
troop
said
willet
and
save
em
if
they
will
let
us
you
agree
with
me
dont
you
tayoga
the
great
bear
is
right
and
youll
back
me
up
of
course
robert
will
you
help
us
too
black
rifle
the
singular
man
smiled
again
but
his
smile
was
not
like
that
of
anybody
else
it
was
sinister
and
full
of
menace
it
was
the
smile
of
a
man
who
rejoiced
in
sanguinary
work
and
it
made
robert
think
again
of
his
extraordinary
history
around
which
the
border
had
built
so
much
of
truth
and
legend
i
will
help
of
course
he
replied
its
my
trade
it
was
my
purpose
to
warn
em
before
i
met
you
but
i
feared
they
would
not
listen
to
me
now
the
words
of
four
may
sound
more
real
to
em
than
the
words
of
one
then
lead
the
way
said
willet
tis
not
a
time
to
linger
black
rifle
without
another
word
threw
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
started
toward
the
north
the
others
falling
into
indian
file
behind
him
a
light
pleased
smile
played
over
his
massive
and
rugged
features
more
than
the
rest
he
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
combat
they
did
not
seek
battle
and
they
fought
only
when
they
were
compelled
to
do
so
but
he
with
his
whole
nature
embittered
forever
by
that
massacre
of
long
ago
loved
it
for
its
own
sake
he
had
ranged
the
border
a
torch
of
fire
for
years
and
now
he
foresaw
more
of
the
revenge
that
he
craved
incessantly
he
led
without
hesitation
straight
toward
the
north
all
four
were
accomplished
trailers
and
the
flitting
figures
were
soundless
as
they
made
their
swift
march
through
the
forest
in
a
half
hour
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
rather
high
hill
and
black
rifle
stopping
pointed
with
a
long
forefinger
toward
a
low
and
dim
light
the
camp
of
the
pennsylvanians
he
said
with
bitter
irony
as
i
told
you
fearing
lest
the
savages
should
miss
em
in
the
forest
they
keep
their
fire
burning
as
a
beacon
dont
be
too
hard
on
em
black
rifle
said
willet
maybe
they
come
from
philadelphia
itself
and
city
bred
men
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
learn
all
about
the
wilderness
in
a
few
days
theyll
learn
when
its
too
late
at
the
muzzles
of
the
french
and
indian
rifles
rejoined
black
rifle
abating
a
little
his
tone
of
savage
derision
at
least
theyre
likely
to
be
brave
men
said
willet
and
now
what
do
you
think
will
be
our
best
manner
of
approaching
em
well
walk
directly
toward
their
fire
the
four
of
us
abreast
theyll
blaze
away
all
fifty
of
em
together
as
soon
as
they
see
us
but
the
darkness
will
spoil
their
aim
and
at
least
one
of
us
will
be
left
alive
able
to
walk
and
able
to
tell
em
of
their
danger
we
dont
know
wholl
be
the
lucky
man
but
well
see
come
come
captain
jack
give
em
a
chance
they
may
be
a
more
likely
lot
than
you
think
you
three
wait
here
and
ill
go
forward
and
announce
our
coming
i
dare
say
well
be
welcome
willet
advanced
boldly
toward
the
fire
which
he
soon
saw
consisted
of
a
great
bed
of
coals
surrounded
by
sleepers
but
the
figures
of
men
pacing
back
and
forth
showed
that
the
watch
had
not
been
neglected
although
in
the
deep
forest
such
sentinels
would
be
but
little
protection
against
the
kind
of
ambush
the
french
and
indians
were
able
to
lay
not
caring
to
come
within
the
circle
of
light
lest
he
be
fired
upon
the
hunter
whistled
and
when
he
saw
that
the
sentinels
were
at
attention
he
whistled
again
then
he
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
walked
boldly
toward
the
fire
who
are
you
a
voice
demanded
sharply
and
a
young
man
in
a
fine
uniform
stood
up
in
front
of
the
fire
the
hunters
quick
and
penetrating
look
noted
that
he
was
tall
built
well
and
that
his
face
was
frank
and
open
my
name
is
david
willet
he
replied
and
i
am
sometimes
called
by
my
friends
the
iroquois
the
great
bear
behind
me
in
the
woods
are
three
comrades
young
robert
lennox
of
new
york
and
albany
tayoga
a
young
warrior
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
the
famous
hunter
and
border
fighter
of
whom
everybody
has
heard
captain
jack
black
hunter
or
black
rifle
as
he
has
been
called
variously
i
know
the
name
replied
the
young
man
and
yours
too
mr
willet
my
own
is
colden
james
colden
of
philadelphia
and
i
am
in
command
of
this
troop
sent
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
against
the
french
and
indians
will
you
call
your
comrades
mr
willet
all
of
you
are
welcome
the
hunter
whistled
again
and
robert
tayoga
and
black
rifle
advancing
from
the
forest
came
within
the
area
of
half
light
cast
by
the
glow
from
the
coals
young
captain
colden
watching
them
with
the
most
intense
curiosity
as
they
approached
and
well
he
might
feel
surprise
all
even
robert
wore
the
dress
of
the
wilderness
and
their
appearance
at
such
a
time
was
uncommon
and
striking
most
of
the
soldiers
had
been
awakened
by
the
voices
and
were
sitting
up
rubbing
sleepy
eyes
robert
saw
at
once
that
they
were
city
men
singularly
out
of
place
in
the
vast
forest
and
the
darkness
we
welcome
you
to
our
camp
said
young
captain
colden
with
dignity
if
you
are
hungry
we
have
food
and
if
you
are
without
blankets
we
can
furnish
them
to
you
willet
and
tayoga
looked
at
robert
and
he
knew
they
expected
him
to
fill
his
usual
role
of
spokesman
the
words
rushed
to
his
lips
but
they
were
held
there
by
embarrassment
the
soldiers
who
had
been
awakened
were
already
going
back
to
sleep
captain
colden
sat
down
on
a
log
and
waited
for
them
to
state
their
wants
then
robert
spoke
knowing
they
could
not
afford
to
delay
we
thank
you
captain
colden
he
said
for
the
offer
of
supper
and
bed
but
i
must
say
to
you
sir
that
its
no
time
for
either
i
dont
take
your
meaning
mr
lennox
tayoga
mr
willet
and
black
rifle
are
the
best
scouts
in
the
wilderness
and
before
sunset
they
saw
smoke
on
the
horizon
then
they
saw
smoke
answering
smoke
and
black
rifle
has
seen
more
the
french
and
indians
sir
are
in
the
forest
and
theyre
led
too
by
frenchmen
young
james
colden
was
a
brave
man
and
his
eyes
glittered
we
ask
nothing
better
than
to
meet
em
he
said
at
the
first
breath
of
dawn
well
march
against
em
if
your
friends
will
only
be
so
good
as
to
show
us
the
way
its
not
a
matter
of
waiting
until
dawn
nor
even
of
going
to
meet
em
theyll
bring
the
battle
to
us
you
and
your
force
captain
colden
are
surrounded
already
the
young
captain
stared
at
robert
but
his
eyes
were
full
of
incredulity
several
of
the
soldiers
were
standing
near
and
they
too
heard
but
the
warning
found
no
answer
in
their
minds
robert
looked
around
at
the
men
asleep
and
the
others
ready
to
follow
them
and
despite
his
instinctive
liking
for
colden
his
anger
began
to
rise
i
said
that
you
were
surrounded
he
repeated
sharply
and
its
no
time
captain
colden
for
unbelief
mr
willet
tayoga
and
i
saw
the
signals
of
the
enemy
but
black
rifle
here
has
looked
upon
the
warriors
themselves
theyre
led
too
by
the
french
and
the
best
of
all
the
french
forest
captains
st
luc
is
undoubtedly
with
them
off
there
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
north
and
a
little
of
the
high
color
left
coldens
face
the
youths
manner
was
so
earnest
and
his
words
were
spoken
with
so
much
power
of
conviction
that
they
could
not
fail
to
impress
you
really
mean
that
the
french
and
indians
are
here
that
theyre
planning
to
attack
us
tonight
said
the
philadelphian
beyond
a
doubt
and
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
them
colden
took
a
few
steps
back
and
forth
and
then
like
the
brave
young
man
he
was
he
swallowed
his
pride
i
confess
that
i
dont
know
much
of
the
forest
nor
do
my
men
he
said
and
so
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
four
to
help
me
well
do
it
gladly
said
robert
what
do
you
propose
dave
i
think
wed
better
draw
off
some
distance
from
the
fire
replied
the
hunter
to
the
right
there
is
a
low
hill
covered
with
thick
brush
and
old
logs
thrown
down
by
an
ancient
storm
its
the
very
place
then
said
captain
colden
briskly
well
occupy
it
inside
of
five
minutes
up
men
up
the
sleepers
were
awakened
rapidly
and
although
they
were
awkward
and
made
much
more
noise
than
was
necessary
they
obeyed
their
captains
sharp
order
and
marched
away
with
all
their
arms
and
stores
to
the
thicket
on
the
hill
where
as
willet
had
predicted
they
found
also
a
network
of
fallen
trees
affording
a
fine
shelter
and
defense
here
they
crouched
and
willet
enjoined
upon
them
the
necessity
of
silence
sir
said
young
captain
colden
again
putting
down
his
pride
i
beg
to
thank
you
and
your
comrades
you
dont
owe
us
any
thanks
its
just
what
we
ought
to
have
done
said
willet
lightly
the
wilderness
often
turns
a
false
face
to
those
who
are
not
used
to
it
and
if
we
hadnt
warned
you
wed
have
deserved
shooting
the
faint
whine
of
a
wolf
came
from
a
point
far
in
the
north
its
one
of
their
signals
said
willet
theyll
attack
inside
of
an
hour
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
and
waited
every
heart
beating
hard
chapter
ii
the
ambush
robert
now
had
much
experience
of
indian
attack
and
forest
warfare
but
it
always
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
his
vivid
and
uncommon
imagination
the
great
pulses
in
his
throat
and
temples
leaped
and
his
ear
became
so
keen
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
hear
the
fall
of
the
leaf
in
the
forest
it
was
this
acute
sharpening
of
the
senses
the
painting
of
pictures
before
him
that
gave
him
the
gift
of
golden
speech
that
the
indians
had
first
noticed
in
him
he
saw
and
heard
much
that
others
could
neither
hear
nor
see
and
the
words
to
describe
it
were
always
ready
to
pour
forth
willet
and
tayoga
were
crouched
near
him
their
rifles
thrust
forward
a
little
and
just
beyond
them
was
captain
colden
who
had
drawn
a
small
sword
more
as
an
evidence
of
command
than
as
a
weapon
the
men
city
bred
were
silent
but
the
faces
of
some
of
them
still
expressed
amazement
and
incredulity
roberts
quick
and
powerful
imagination
instantly
projected
itself
into
their
minds
and
he
saw
as
they
saw
to
them
the
cry
of
a
wolf
was
the
cry
of
a
real
wolf
the
forest
was
dark
lonely
and
uncomfortable
but
it
was
empty
of
any
foe
and
the
four
who
had
come
to
them
were
merely
trying
to
create
a
sense
of
their
own
importance
they
began
to
move
restlessly
and
it
required
captain
coldens
whispered
but
sharp
command
to
still
them
again
the
cry
of
the
wolf
used
much
by
both
the
indians
and
the
borderers
as
a
signal
came
now
from
the
east
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
minute
it
was
repeated
from
the
west
call
and
answer
were
a
relief
to
robert
whose
faculties
were
attuned
to
such
a
high
degree
that
any
relief
to
the
strain
though
it
brought
the
certainty
of
attack
was
welcome
youre
sure
those
cries
were
made
by
our
enemies
said
young
colden
beyond
a
doubt
replied
willet
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
note
and
that
of
a
genuine
wolf
but
then
ive
spent
many
years
in
the
wilderness
and
i
had
to
learn
these
things
in
order
to
live
theyll
send
forward
scouts
and
theyll
expect
to
find
you
and
your
men
around
the
fire
most
of
you
asleep
when
they
miss
you
there
theyll
try
to
locate
you
and
theyll
soon
trail
us
to
these
bushes
captain
james
colden
had
his
share
of
pride
and
much
faith
in
himself
but
he
had
nobility
of
soul
too
i
believe
you
implicitly
mr
willet
he
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
and
your
friends
the
enemy
would
have
been
upon
us
when
we
expected
him
not
at
all
and
tis
most
likely
that
all
of
us
would
have
been
killed
and
scalped
so
i
thank
you
now
lest
i
fall
in
the
battle
and
it
be
too
late
then
to
express
my
gratitude
it
was
a
little
bit
formal
and
a
little
bit
youthful
but
willet
accepted
the
words
in
the
fine
spirit
in
which
they
were
uttered
what
we
did
was
no
more
than
we
should
have
done
he
replied
and
youll
pay
us
back
in
such
times
as
these
everybody
ought
to
help
everybody
else
caution
your
soldiers
captain
wont
you
not
to
make
any
noise
at
all
the
wolf
will
howl
no
more
and
i
fancy
their
scouts
are
now
within
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
the
fire
im
glad
its
turned
darker
the
troop
hidden
in
the
bushes
was
now
completely
silent
the
philadelphia
men
used
to
contiguous
houses
and
streets
were
not
afraid
but
they
were
appalled
by
their
extraordinary
position
at
night
in
the
deep
brush
of
an
unknown
wilderness
with
a
creeping
foe
coming
down
upon
them
many
a
hand
quivered
upon
the
rifle
barrel
but
the
heart
of
its
owner
did
not
tremble
the
moonlight
was
scant
and
the
stars
were
few
to
the
city
men
trees
and
bushes
melted
together
in
a
general
blackness
relieved
only
by
a
single
point
of
light
where
the
fire
yet
smoldered
but
robert
kneeling
by
the
side
of
tayoga
saw
with
his
trained
eyes
the
separate
trunks
stretching
away
like
columns
and
then
far
beyond
the
fire
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
red
feather
raised
for
a
moment
above
the
undergrowth
did
you
see
he
whispered
to
tayoga
yes
it
was
a
painted
feather
in
the
scalp
lock
of
a
huron
replied
the
onondaga
and
where
he
is
others
are
sure
to
be
well
spoken
dagaeoga
they
have
discovered
already
that
the
soldiers
are
not
by
the
fire
and
now
they
will
search
for
them
they
will
lie
almost
flat
on
their
faces
and
follow
a
little
the
broad
trail
the
city
men
have
left
doubtless
dagaeoga
willet
had
already
warned
captain
colden
and
the
soldiers
were
ready
tayoga
was
on
roberts
right
and
on
his
left
was
black
rifle
to
whom
his
attention
was
now
attracted
the
mans
eyes
were
blazing
in
his
dark
face
and
his
crouched
figure
was
tense
like
that
of
a
lion
about
to
spring
face
and
attitude
alike
expressed
the
most
eager
anticipation
and
robert
shuddered
the
ranger
would
add
more
lives
to
the
toll
of
his
revenge
and
yet
the
youth
felt
sympathy
for
him
too
then
his
mind
became
wholly
absorbed
in
the
battle
which
obviously
was
so
close
at
hand
their
position
was
strong
just
behind
them
the
thickets
ended
in
a
cliff
hard
to
climb
and
on
the
right
was
an
open
space
that
the
enemy
could
not
cross
without
being
seen
hence
the
chief
danger
was
in
front
and
on
the
left
and
most
of
the
men
watched
those
points
i
can
see
the
bushes
moving
about
a
hundred
yards
away
whispered
tayoga
a
warrior
is
there
but
to
fire
at
him
would
be
shooting
at
random
let
them
begin
it
theyll
open
soon
theyll
know
by
our
absence
from
the
fire
that
were
looking
for
em
spoken
well
dagaeoga
youll
be
a
warrior
some
day
robert
smiled
in
the
dark
tayoga
himself
was
so
great
a
warrior
that
he
could
preserve
his
sense
of
humor
upon
the
eve
of
a
deadly
battle
robert
also
saw
bushes
moving
now
but
nothing
was
definite
enough
for
a
shot
and
he
waited
with
his
fingers
on
the
trigger
the
enemy
is
at
hand
captain
colden
said
willet
if
you
will
look
very
closely
at
the
thicket
about
one
hundred
yards
directly
in
front
of
us
youll
see
the
leaves
shaking
yes
i
can
make
out
some
movement
there
said
colden
theyve
discovered
of
course
that
weve
left
the
fire
and
they
know
also
where
we
are
do
you
think
theyll
try
to
rush
us
not
at
all
its
not
the
indian
way
nor
is
it
the
way
either
of
the
french
who
go
with
them
they
know
your
men
are
rawpardon
meinexperienced
troops
and
theyll
put
a
cruel
burden
upon
your
patience
they
may
wait
for
hours
and
theyll
try
in
every
manner
to
wear
them
out
and
to
provoke
them
at
last
into
some
rash
movement
youll
have
to
guard
most
captain
colden
against
the
temper
of
your
troop
if
youll
take
advice
from
one
whos
a
veteran
in
the
woods
youd
better
threaten
them
with
death
for
disobedience
of
orders
as
i
said
before
im
grateful
to
you
for
any
advice
or
suggestion
mr
willet
this
seems
a
long
way
from
philadelphia
and
ill
confess
im
not
so
very
much
at
home
here
he
crawled
among
his
men
and
willet
and
robert
heard
him
threatening
them
in
fierce
whispers
and
their
replies
that
they
would
be
cautious
and
patient
it
was
well
that
willet
had
given
the
advice
as
a
full
hour
passed
without
any
sign
from
the
foe
troops
even
more
experienced
than
the
city
men
might
well
have
concluded
it
was
a
false
alarm
and
that
the
forest
contained
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
bear
there
was
no
sound
and
captain
colden
himself
asked
if
the
warriors
had
not
gone
away
not
a
chance
of
it
replied
willet
they
think
theyre
certain
of
a
victory
and
they
would
not
dream
of
retiring
and
we
have
more
long
waiting
in
the
dark
to
do
i
warned
you
there
is
no
other
way
to
fight
such
enemies
we
must
never
make
the
mistake
of
undervaluing
them
captain
colden
sighed
he
had
a
gallant
heart
and
he
and
his
troop
had
made
a
fine
parade
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
before
he
started
for
the
frontier
but
he
had
expected
to
meet
the
french
in
the
open
perhaps
with
a
bugle
playing
and
he
would
charge
at
the
head
of
his
men
waving
the
neat
small
sword
now
buckled
to
his
side
instead
he
lay
in
a
black
thicket
awaiting
the
attack
of
creeping
savages
nevertheless
he
put
down
his
pride
for
the
third
time
and
resolved
to
trust
the
four
who
had
come
so
opportunely
to
his
aid
and
who
seemed
to
be
so
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
wilderness
another
hour
dragged
its
weary
length
away
and
there
was
no
sound
of
anything
stirring
in
the
forest
the
skies
lightened
a
little
as
the
moon
came
out
casting
a
faint
whitish
tint
over
trees
and
bushes
but
the
brave
young
captain
was
yet
unable
to
see
any
trace
of
the
enemy
do
you
feel
quite
sure
that
were
still
besieged
he
whispered
to
willet
yes
captain
replied
the
hunter
and
as
i
said
patience
is
the
commodity
we
need
most
it
would
be
fatal
for
us
to
force
the
action
but
i
dont
think
we
have
much
longer
to
wait
since
they
cant
induce
us
to
take
some
rash
step
theyre
likely
to
make
a
movement
soon
i
see
the
bushes
waving
again
said
tayoga
it
is
proof
that
the
warriors
are
approaching
it
would
be
well
for
the
soldiers
to
lie
flat
for
a
little
while
captain
colden
adhering
to
his
resolution
to
take
the
advice
of
his
new
friends
crept
along
the
line
telling
the
men
in
sharp
whispers
to
hug
the
earth
a
command
that
they
obeyed
willingly
as
the
darkness
the
silence
and
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
danger
had
begun
to
weigh
heavily
upon
their
nerves
robert
saw
a
bead
of
flame
among
the
bushes
and
heard
a
sharp
report
a
bullet
cut
a
bough
over
his
head
and
a
leaf
drifted
down
upon
his
face
the
soldiers
shifted
uneasily
and
began
to
thrust
their
rifles
forward
but
again
the
stern
command
of
the
young
captain
prompted
by
the
hunter
held
them
down
twas
intended
merely
to
draw
us
said
willet
theyre
sure
were
in
this
wood
but
of
course
they
dont
know
the
exact
location
of
our
men
theyre
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
the
bright
uniforms
but
if
the
men
keep
very
low
they
wont
get
it
it
was
a
tremendous
trial
for
young
and
raw
troops
but
they
managed
to
still
their
nerves
and
to
remain
crouched
and
motionless
a
second
shot
was
fired
soon
and
then
a
third
but
like
the
first
they
were
trial
bullets
and
both
went
high
black
rifle
grew
impatient
the
memory
of
his
murdered
family
began
to
press
upon
him
once
more
the
night
was
black
but
now
it
looked
red
to
him
lying
almost
flat
he
slowly
pulled
himself
forward
like
a
great
wild
beast
stalking
its
prey
colden
looked
at
him
and
then
at
willet
who
nodded
dont
try
to
stop
him
whispered
the
hunter
because
hell
go
anyhow
besides
its
time
for
us
to
reply
to
their
shots
the
dark
form
moving
forward
without
noise
had
a
singular
fascination
for
robert
his
imagination
which
colored
and
magnified
everything
made
black
rifle
sinister
and
supernatural
the
complete
absence
of
sound
as
he
advanced
heightened
the
effect
not
a
leaf
nor
a
blade
of
grass
rustled
presently
he
stopped
and
robert
saw
the
black
muzzle
of
his
rifle
shoot
forward
a
stream
of
flame
leaped
forth
and
then
the
man
quickly
slid
into
a
new
position
a
fierce
shout
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
a
half
dozen
shots
were
fired
bullets
again
cut
twigs
and
leaves
over
roberts
head
but
all
of
them
went
too
high
do
you
think
black
rifle
hit
his
mark
whispered
robert
to
tayoga
it
is
likely
replied
the
onondaga
but
we
may
never
know
i
think
it
would
be
well
dagaeoga
for
you
and
me
to
go
toward
the
left
they
may
try
to
creep
around
our
flank
and
we
must
meet
them
there
willet
and
colden
approved
of
the
plan
and
a
half
dozen
of
the
best
soldiers
went
with
them
the
movement
proving
to
be
wise
as
within
five
minutes
a
scattering
fire
was
opened
upon
that
point
the
soldiers
fired
two
rash
shots
merely
aiming
at
the
reports
and
the
general
blackness
but
robert
and
tayoga
quickly
reduced
them
to
control
insisting
that
they
wait
until
they
saw
a
foe
before
pulling
trigger
again
then
they
sank
back
among
the
bushes
and
remained
quite
still
tayoga
suddenly
drew
a
deep
and
very
long
breath
which
with
him
was
equivalent
to
an
exclamation
what
is
it
tayoga
asked
robert
i
saw
a
bit
of
a
uniform
and
i
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
an
officer
then
we
were
right
in
our
surmise
that
the
french
are
here
leading
the
warriors
it
was
but
a
glimpse
but
it
showed
the
curve
of
his
jaw
and
chin
and
i
knew
him
he
is
one
who
is
beginning
to
be
important
in
your
life
dagaeoga
st
luc
none
other
i
could
not
be
mistaken
he
is
leading
the
attack
upon
us
perhaps
tandakora
is
with
him
the
frenchman
does
not
like
the
ojibway
but
war
makes
strange
comrades
that
was
close
a
bullet
whistled
directly
between
them
and
tayoga
kneeling
fired
in
return
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
aim
as
a
warrior
uttered
the
death
cry
and
a
fierce
shout
of
rage
from
a
dozen
throats
followed
robert
imaginative
ready
to
flame
up
in
a
moment
exulted
not
because
a
warrior
had
fallen
but
because
the
flank
attack
upon
his
own
people
had
been
stopped
in
the
beginning
st
luc
himself
would
have
admitted
that
the
americans
or
the
english
as
he
would
have
called
them
were
acting
wisely
the
soldiers
stirred
by
the
successful
shot
showed
again
a
great
desire
to
fire
at
the
black
woods
but
robert
and
the
onondaga
still
kept
them
down
a
crackling
fire
arose
behind
them
showing
that
the
main
force
had
engaged
and
now
and
then
the
warriors
uttered
defiant
cries
but
robert
had
enough
power
of
will
to
watch
in
front
sure
that
willet
and
black
rifle
were
sufficient
to
guide
the
central
defense
he
observed
intently
the
segment
of
the
circle
in
front
of
them
and
he
wondered
if
st
luc
would
appear
there
again
but
he
concluded
that
he
would
not
since
the
failure
of
the
attempted
surprise
at
that
point
would
be
likely
to
send
him
back
to
the
main
force
do
you
think
theyll
go
away
and
concentrate
in
front
he
asked
tayoga
no
replied
the
onondaga
they
still
think
perhaps
that
they
have
only
the
soldiers
from
the
city
to
meet
and
they
may
attempt
a
rush
robert
crept
from
soldier
to
soldier
cautioning
every
one
to
take
shelter
and
to
have
his
rifle
ready
and
they
being
good
men
though
without
experience
obeyed
the
one
who
so
obviously
knew
what
he
was
doing
meantime
the
combat
behind
them
proceeded
with
vigor
the
shots
crashing
in
volleys
accompanied
by
shouts
and
once
by
the
cry
of
a
stricken
soldier
it
was
evident
that
st
luc
was
now
pushing
the
battle
and
robert
was
quite
sure
the
attack
on
the
flank
would
soon
come
again
they
did
not
wait
much
longer
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
from
the
undergrowth
and
rushed
straight
toward
them
a
white
man
now
in
front
the
light
was
sufficient
for
robert
to
see
that
the
leader
was
not
st
luc
and
then
without
hesitation
he
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
the
man
fell
tayoga
stopped
the
rush
of
a
warrior
and
the
bullets
of
the
soldiers
wounded
others
but
their
white
leader
was
gone
and
indians
have
little
love
for
an
attack
upon
a
sheltered
enemy
so
the
charge
broke
before
it
was
half
way
to
the
defenders
and
the
savages
vanished
in
the
thickets
the
soldiers
began
to
exult
but
robert
bade
them
reload
as
fast
as
possible
and
keep
well
under
cover
the
warriors
from
new
points
would
fire
at
every
exposed
head
and
they
could
not
afford
to
relax
their
caution
for
an
instant
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
youthful
veterans
of
the
forest
to
keep
the
older
but
inexperienced
men
from
the
city
under
cover
they
had
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
see
the
indians
who
were
shooting
at
them
and
against
whom
they
were
sending
their
bullets
in
spite
of
every
command
and
entreaty
a
man
would
raise
his
head
now
and
then
and
one
as
he
did
so
received
a
bullet
between
the
eyes
falling
back
quietly
dead
before
he
touched
the
ground
a
brave
lad
has
been
lost
whispered
tayoga
to
robert
but
he
has
been
an
involuntary
example
to
the
rest
the
onondaga
spoke
in
his
precise
school
english
but
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
as
the
soldiers
now
became
much
more
cautious
and
controlled
their
impulse
to
raise
up
for
a
look
after
every
shot
another
man
was
wounded
but
the
hurt
was
not
serious
and
he
went
on
with
his
firing
robert
seeing
that
the
line
on
the
flank
could
be
held
without
great
difficulty
left
tayoga
in
command
and
crept
back
to
the
main
force
where
the
bullets
were
coming
much
faster
two
of
the
soldiers
in
the
center
had
been
slain
and
three
had
been
wounded
but
captain
colden
had
not
given
ground
he
was
sitting
behind
a
rocky
outcrop
and
at
the
suggestion
of
willet
was
giving
orders
to
his
men
oppressed
at
first
by
the
ambush
and
weight
of
responsibility
he
was
exulting
now
in
their
ability
to
check
the
savage
onset
robert
was
quite
willing
to
play
a
little
to
his
pride
and
he
said
in
the
formal
military
manner
i
wish
to
report
sir
that
all
is
going
well
on
the
southern
flank
one
of
our
men
has
been
killed
but
we
have
made
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
advance
there
thank
you
mr
lennox
said
the
young
captain
with
dignity
we
have
also
had
some
success
here
due
chiefly
to
the
good
advice
of
mr
willet
and
the
prowess
and
sharpshooting
of
the
extraordinary
man
whom
you
call
black
rifle
see
him
now
he
indicated
a
dark
figure
a
little
distance
ahead
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
as
robert
looked
a
jet
of
fire
leaped
from
the
muzzle
of
the
mans
rifle
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
cry
in
the
forest
i
think
he
has
slain
more
of
our
enemies
than
the
rest
of
us
combined
said
captain
colden
robert
shuddered
a
little
but
those
who
lived
on
the
border
became
used
to
strange
things
the
constant
struggle
for
existence
hardened
the
nerves
and
terrible
scenes
did
not
dwell
long
in
the
mind
he
bent
forward
for
a
better
look
and
a
bullet
cut
the
hair
upon
his
forehead
he
started
back
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
seared
by
lightning
and
willet
looked
at
him
anxiously
the
lead
burned
as
it
passed
the
lad
said
but
the
skin
is
not
broken
i
was
guilty
of
the
same
rashness
for
which
i
have
been
lecturing
the
men
on
the
flank
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
who
fired
the
shot
said
willet
i
think
it
was
the
canadian
dubois
whom
we
saw
with
st
luc
tayoga
saw
st
luc
himself
on
the
flank
said
robert
and
so
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
leading
the
attack
the
fact
makes
it
certain
that
it
will
be
carried
on
with
persistence
we
shall
be
here
still
besieged
when
day
comes
said
the
hunter
its
lucky
that
the
cliff
protects
us
on
one
side
as
if
to
disprove
his
assertion
all
the
firing
stopped
suddenly
and
for
a
long
time
the
forest
was
silent
fortunately
they
had
water
in
their
canteens
and
they
were
able
to
soothe
the
thirst
of
the
wounded
men
they
talked
also
of
victory
and
knowing
that
it
was
only
two
or
three
hours
until
dawn
captain
coldens
spirits
rose
to
great
heights
he
was
sure
now
that
the
warriors
defeated
had
gone
away
this
frenchman
st
luc
of
whom
they
talked
might
be
a
great
partisan
leader
but
he
would
know
when
the
price
he
was
paying
became
too
high
and
would
draw
off
the
men
believed
their
captain
and
despite
the
earnest
protest
of
the
foresters
began
to
stir
in
the
bushes
shortly
before
dawn
a
rifle
shot
came
from
the
opposing
thickets
and
one
of
them
would
stir
no
more
captain
colden
appalled
was
all
remorse
he
took
the
death
of
the
man
directly
to
himself
and
told
willet
with
emotion
that
all
advice
of
his
would
now
be
taken
at
once
let
the
men
lie
as
close
as
they
can
said
the
hunter
the
day
will
soon
be
here
robert
found
shelter
behind
the
trunk
of
a
huge
oak
and
crouched
there
his
nerves
relaxing
he
did
not
believe
any
further
movement
of
the
enemy
would
come
now
as
the
great
tension
passed
for
a
time
he
was
conscious
of
an
immense
weariness
the
strain
upon
all
the
physical
senses
and
upon
the
mind
as
well
made
him
weak
it
was
a
luxury
merely
to
sit
there
with
his
back
against
the
bark
and
rest
near
him
he
heard
the
soldiers
moving
softly
and
now
and
then
a
wounded
man
asking
for
water
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
it
had
upon
his
face
the
freshness
of
the
dawn
he
wondered
what
the
day
would
bring
the
light
that
came
with
it
would
be
cheerful
and
uplifting
but
it
would
disclose
their
covert
at
least
in
part
and
st
luc
might
lead
both
french
and
indians
in
one
great
rush
better
eat
a
little
said
tayoga
who
had
returned
to
the
center
remember
that
we
have
plenty
of
food
in
our
knapsacks
nor
are
our
canteens
empty
i
had
forgotten
it
said
robert
and
he
ate
and
drank
sparingly
the
breeze
continued
to
freshen
and
in
the
east
the
dawn
broke
gray
turning
to
silver
and
then
to
red
and
gold
the
forest
soon
stood
out
an
infinite
tracery
in
the
dazzling
light
and
then
a
white
fleck
appeared
against
the
wall
of
green
a
flag
of
truce
exclaimed
captain
colden
what
can
they
want
to
say
to
us
let
the
bearer
of
the
flag
appear
first
suggested
willet
and
then
well
talk
with
em
the
figure
of
a
man
holding
up
a
white
handkerchief
appeared
and
it
was
st
luc
himself
as
neat
and
irreproachable
as
if
he
were
attending
a
ball
in
the
intendants
palace
at
quebec
robert
knew
that
he
must
have
been
active
in
the
battle
all
through
the
night
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
it
he
wore
a
fine
closefitting
uniform
of
dark
blue
and
the
handkerchief
of
lace
was
held
aloft
on
the
point
of
a
small
sword
the
golden
hilt
of
which
glittered
in
the
morning
sunlight
he
was
a
strange
figure
in
the
forest
but
a
most
gallant
one
and
to
roberts
eyes
a
chevalier
without
fear
and
without
reproach
i
know
that
you
speak
good
french
mr
lennox
said
captain
colden
will
you
go
forward
and
meet
the
frenchman
you
will
perhaps
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
if
not
you
can
refer
to
mr
willet
and
myself
i
will
do
my
best
sir
said
robert
glad
of
the
chance
to
meet
st
luc
face
to
face
again
he
did
not
know
why
his
heart
leaped
so
every
time
he
saw
the
chevalier
but
his
friendship
for
him
was
undeniable
it
seemed
too
that
st
luc
liked
him
and
robert
felt
sure
that
whatever
hostility
his
official
enemy
felt
for
the
english
cause
there
was
none
for
him
personally
unconsciously
he
began
to
arrange
his
own
attire
of
forest
green
beautifully
dyed
and
decorated
deerskin
that
he
might
not
look
less
neat
than
the
man
whom
he
was
going
to
meet
st
luc
was
standing
under
the
wide
boughs
of
an
oak
his
gold
hilted
rapier
returned
to
its
sheath
and
his
white
lace
handkerchief
to
its
pocket
the
smile
of
welcome
upon
his
face
as
he
saw
the
herald
was
genuine
i
salute
you
mr
lennox
he
said
and
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
i
learned
that
you
were
in
the
force
besieged
by
us
and
its
a
pleasure
to
see
that
youve
escaped
unhurt
when
last
we
met
the
honors
were
yours
you
fairly
defeated
me
at
the
word
play
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
you
will
admit
that
the
savage
tandakora
played
into
your
hands
most
opportunely
you
will
admit
also
that
word
play
is
not
sword
play
and
that
in
the
appeal
to
the
sword
we
have
the
advantage
of
you
it
may
seem
so
to
one
who
sees
with
your
eyes
and
from
your
position
said
robert
but
being
myself
im
compelled
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
from
our
side
i
wish
to
say
first
however
chevalier
de
st
luc
that
since
you
have
wished
me
a
very
good
morning
i
even
wish
you
a
better
st
luc
laughed
gayly
you
and
i
will
never
be
enemies
it
would
be
against
nature
he
said
no
well
never
be
enemies
but
why
is
it
against
nature
perhaps
i
was
not
happy
in
my
phrase
we
like
each
other
too
well
andin
a
wayour
temperaments
resemble
too
much
to
engender
a
mutual
hate
but
well
to
business
mines
a
mission
of
mercy
i
come
to
receive
the
surrender
of
your
friends
and
yourself
since
continued
resistance
to
us
will
be
vain
robert
smiled
his
gift
of
golden
speech
was
again
making
its
presence
felt
he
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
before
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
they
had
spoken
where
all
might
hear
now
they
two
alone
could
hear
but
he
felt
that
the
test
was
the
same
in
kind
he
knew
that
his
friends
in
the
thickets
behind
him
were
watching
and
he
was
equally
sure
that
french
and
savages
in
the
thickets
before
him
were
watching
too
he
had
no
doubt
the
baleful
eyes
of
tandakora
were
glaring
at
him
at
that
very
moment
and
that
the
fingers
of
the
ojibway
were
eager
to
grasp
his
scalp
the
idea
singularly
enough
caused
him
amusement
because
his
imagination
vivid
as
usual
leaped
far
ahead
and
he
foresaw
that
his
hair
would
never
become
a
trophy
for
tandakora
you
smile
mr
lennox
said
st
luc
do
you
find
my
words
so
amusing
not
amusing
chevalier
oh
no
and
if
in
truth
i
found
them
so
i
would
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
smile
but
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
your
official
enemy
has
underrated
the
strength
of
your
position
that
is
why
my
eyes
expressed
contenti
would
scarcely
call
it
a
smile
i
see
once
more
that
youre
a
master
of
words
mr
lennox
you
play
with
them
as
the
wind
sports
among
the
leaves
but
i
dont
speak
in
jest
monsieur
de
st
luc
im
not
in
command
here
im
merely
a
spokesman
a
herald
or
a
messenger
in
whichever
way
you
should
choose
to
define
me
captain
james
colden
a
gallant
young
officer
of
philadelphia
is
our
leader
but
in
this
instance
i
dont
feel
the
need
of
consulting
him
i
know
that
your
offer
is
kindly
that
it
comes
from
a
generous
soul
but
however
much
it
may
disappoint
you
i
must
decline
it
our
resistance
in
the
night
has
been
quite
successful
we
have
inflicted
upon
you
much
more
damage
than
you
have
inflicted
upon
us
and
ive
no
doubt
the
day
will
witness
a
battle
continued
in
the
same
proportion
st
luc
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
not
loud
but
gayly
and
with
unction
robert
reddened
but
he
could
not
take
offense
as
he
saw
that
none
was
meant
i
no
longer
wonder
at
my
defeat
by
you
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
said
the
chevalier
since
youre
not
merely
a
master
of
words
youre
a
masterartist
ive
no
doubt
if
i
listen
to
you
youll
persuade
me
its
not
you
but
we
who
are
besieged
and
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
yield
to
you
without
further
ado
perhaps
youre
not
so
very
far
wrong
said
robert
recovering
his
assurance
which
was
nearly
always
great
im
sure
captain
colden
would
receive
your
surrender
and
treat
you
well
the
eyes
of
the
two
met
and
twinkled
tandakora
is
with
us
said
st
luc
and
ive
a
notion
he
wouldnt
relish
it
perhaps
he
distrusts
the
mercy
he
would
receive
at
the
hands
of
your
onondaga
tayoga
and
at
this
point
in
our
dialogue
mr
lennox
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
again
for
the
actions
of
the
ojibway
before
the
war
really
began
i
couldnt
prevent
them
but
since
there
is
genuine
war
he
is
our
ally
and
i
must
accord
to
him
all
the
dignities
and
honors
appertaining
to
his
position
youre
rather
deft
with
words
yourself
monsieur
de
st
luc
once
at
new
york
i
saw
a
juggler
with
balls
who
could
keep
five
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
and
in
some
dim
and
remote
way
you
make
me
think
of
him
youll
pardon
the
illustration
chevalier
because
i
really
mean
it
as
a
compliment
i
pardon
gladly
enough
because
i
see
your
intentions
are
good
we
both
play
with
words
perhaps
because
the
exercise
tickles
our
fancy
but
to
return
to
the
true
spirit
and
essence
of
things
i
warn
you
that
it
would
be
wise
to
surrender
my
force
is
very
much
greater
than
captain
coldens
and
has
him
hemmed
in
if
my
indian
allies
suffer
too
much
in
the
attack
it
will
be
difficult
to
restrain
them
im
not
stating
this
as
a
threatyou
know
me
too
well
for
thatbut
to
make
the
facts
plain
and
to
avoid
something
that
i
should
regret
as
much
as
you
i
dont
think
it
necessary
to
consult
captain
colden
and
without
doing
so
i
decline
your
offer
we
have
food
to
eat
water
to
drink
and
bullets
to
shoot
and
if
you
care
to
take
us
you
must
come
and
do
so
and
that
is
the
final
answer
youre
quite
sure
you
dont
wish
to
consult
your
superior
officer
captain
colden
absolutely
sure
it
would
waste
the
time
of
all
of
us
then
it
seems
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
and
to
use
your
own
fanciful
way
of
putting
it
we
must
go
back
from
the
play
of
words
to
the
play
of
swords
i
see
no
alternative
and
yet
i
hope
that
you
will
survive
the
combat
mr
lennox
ive
the
same
hope
for
you
chevalier
de
st
luc
each
meant
it
and
in
the
same
high
manner
of
the
day
they
saluted
and
withdrew
robert
as
he
walked
back
to
the
thickets
in
which
the
defenders
lay
felt
that
indian
eyes
were
upon
him
and
that
perhaps
an
indian
bullet
would
speed
toward
him
despite
st
luc
tandakora
and
the
savages
around
him
could
not
always
be
controlled
by
their
french
allies
as
was
to
be
shown
too
often
in
this
war
his
sensitive
mind
once
more
turned
fancy
into
reality
and
the
hair
on
his
head
lifted
a
little
but
pride
would
not
let
him
hasten
his
steps
no
gun
was
fired
and
with
an
immense
relief
he
sank
down
behind
a
fallen
log
and
by
the
side
of
colden
and
willet
what
did
the
frenchman
want
asked
the
young
captain
our
instant
and
unconditional
surrender
knowing
how
you
felt
about
it
i
gave
him
your
refusal
at
once
well
done
mr
lennox
he
said
that
in
case
of
a
rush
and
heavy
loss
by
his
indians
he
perhaps
would
not
be
able
to
control
them
in
the
moment
of
victory
which
doubtless
is
true
they
will
know
no
moment
of
victory
we
can
hold
them
off
where
is
tayoga
asked
robert
of
willet
the
hunter
pointed
westward
why
the
cliff
shuts
off
the
way
in
that
direction
said
robert
not
to
a
good
climber
do
you
mean
then
that
tayoga
is
gone
i
saw
him
go
he
went
while
you
were
talking
with
st
luc
why
should
tayoga
leave
us
he
saw
another
smoke
against
the
sky
it
was
but
a
faint
trace
only
an
extremely
keen
eye
would
have
noticed
it
and
having
much
natural
curiosity
tayoga
is
now
on
his
way
to
see
who
built
the
fire
that
made
the
smoke
and
it
may
have
been
made
by
friends
thats
our
hope
robert
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
toward
the
west
the
sky
was
now
clear
there
but
he
knew
that
tayoga
could
not
have
made
any
mistake
then
his
heart
high
once
more
he
settled
himself
down
to
wait
chapter
iii
the
signal
the
day
advanced
brilliant
with
sunshine
and
the
forces
of
st
luc
were
quiet
for
a
long
time
not
a
shot
was
fired
and
it
seemed
to
the
besieged
that
the
forest
was
empty
of
human
beings
save
themselves
robert
did
not
believe
the
french
leader
would
attempt
a
long
siege
since
an
engagement
could
not
be
conducted
in
that
manner
in
the
forest
where
a
result
of
some
kind
must
be
reached
soon
yet
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
plan
st
luc
had
in
mind
and
they
must
wait
until
tayoga
came
young
captain
colden
was
in
good
spirits
it
was
his
first
taste
of
wilderness
warfare
and
he
knew
that
he
had
done
well
the
dead
were
laid
decently
among
the
bushes
to
receive
christian
burial
later
if
the
chance
came
and
the
wounded
their
hurts
bound
up
prepared
to
take
what
part
they
could
in
a
new
battle
robert
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
looked
toward
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
saw
only
a
dazzling
blue
sky
unflecked
by
anything
save
little
white
clouds
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
mission
of
his
young
onondaga
comrade
would
have
any
success
he
crept
back
to
the
side
of
willet
have
you
any
opinion
dave
about
the
smoke
that
tayoga
saw
he
asked
none
robert
just
a
hope
it
might
have
been
made
by
another
french
and
indian
band
most
probably
it
was
but
there
is
a
chance
too
that
friends
built
the
fire
if
its
a
force
of
any
size
it
could
hardly
be
english
i
dont
think
any
troop
of
ours
except
captain
coldens
is
in
this
region
we
cant
look
for
help
from
our
own
race
robert
was
silent
gazing
intently
into
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
recognized
the
immense
difficulties
of
their
position
indians
if
an
attack
or
two
of
theirs
failed
would
be
likely
to
go
away
but
the
french
and
especially
st
luc
would
increase
their
persistence
and
hold
them
to
the
task
he
returned
to
the
forest
and
his
attention
was
drawn
once
more
by
black
rifle
the
man
was
lying
almost
flat
in
the
thicket
and
evidently
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
foe
as
he
was
writhing
slowly
forward
like
a
great
beast
of
prey
and
his
eyes
once
more
had
the
expectant
look
of
one
who
is
going
to
strike
robert
considered
him
he
knew
that
the
mans
whole
nature
had
been
poisoned
by
the
great
tragedy
in
his
life
and
that
it
gave
him
a
sinister
pleasure
to
inflict
blows
upon
those
who
had
inflicted
the
great
blow
upon
him
yet
he
would
be
useful
in
the
fierce
war
that
was
upon
them
and
he
was
useful
now
black
rifle
crept
forward
two
or
three
yards
more
and
after
he
had
lain
quite
still
for
a
few
moments
he
suddenly
thrust
out
his
rifle
and
fired
a
cry
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
robert
heard
the
sharpshooter
utter
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
knew
that
st
luc
was
one
warrior
less
which
was
good
for
the
defense
but
he
shuddered
a
little
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
steal
through
the
bushes
and
shoot
an
unseeing
enemy
still
black
rifle
was
black
rifle
and
being
what
he
was
he
was
not
to
be
judged
as
other
men
were
after
a
half
hours
silence
the
besiegers
suddenly
opened
fire
from
five
or
six
points
sending
perhaps
two
score
bullets
into
the
wood
clipping
off
many
twigs
and
leaves
which
fell
upon
the
heads
of
the
defenders
captain
colden
did
not
forget
to
be
grateful
to
willet
for
his
insistence
that
the
soldiers
should
always
lie
low
as
the
hostile
lead
instead
of
striking
now
merely
sent
a
harmless
shower
upon
them
but
the
fusillade
was
brief
robert
in
truth
judging
that
it
had
been
against
the
commands
of
st
luc
who
was
too
wise
a
leader
to
wish
ammunition
to
be
wasted
in
random
firing
at
the
advice
of
willet
captain
colden
would
not
let
his
men
reply
restraining
their
eagerness
and
silence
soon
returned
it
was
nearly
noon
now
and
a
huge
golden
sun
shone
over
the
vast
wilderness
in
which
two
little
bands
of
men
fought
mere
motes
in
the
limitless
sea
of
green
robert
ate
some
venison
and
drank
a
little
water
from
the
canteen
of
a
friendly
soldier
then
his
thoughts
turned
again
to
tayoga
the
onondaga
was
a
peerless
runner
he
had
been
gone
long
now
and
what
would
he
find
at
the
base
of
the
smoke
if
it
had
been
the
fire
of
an
enemy
then
he
would
be
back
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
they
would
be
in
no
worse
case
than
before
they
might
try
to
escape
in
the
night
down
the
cliff
but
it
was
not
likely
that
vigilant
foes
would
permit
men
clumsy
in
the
woods
like
the
soldiers
to
steal
away
in
such
a
manner
the
earlier
hours
of
the
afternoon
were
passed
by
the
sharpshooters
on
either
side
trying
to
stalk
one
another
although
robert
had
no
part
in
it
it
was
a
savage
play
that
alternately
fascinated
and
repelled
him
he
had
no
way
to
tell
exactly
but
he
believed
that
two
more
of
the
indians
had
fallen
while
a
soldier
received
a
wound
a
bullet
grazed
black
rifles
head
but
instead
of
daunting
him
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
kind
of
fierce
joy
and
to
inspire
in
him
a
greater
desire
to
slay
these
efforts
since
they
achieved
no
positive
results
soon
died
down
and
both
sides
lay
silent
in
their
coverts
robert
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
behind
a
log
although
he
longed
to
stand
upright
and
walk
about
once
more
like
a
human
being
it
was
now
midafternoon
and
if
the
smoke
had
meant
nothing
good
for
them
it
was
time
for
tayoga
to
be
back
it
was
not
conceivable
that
such
a
marvelous
forester
and
matchless
runner
could
have
been
taken
and
since
he
had
not
come
roberts
heart
again
beat
to
the
tune
of
hope
willet
with
whom
he
talked
a
little
was
of
like
opinion
he
looked
to
tayoga
to
bring
them
help
and
if
he
failed
their
case
already
hard
would
become
harder
the
hunter
did
not
conceal
from
himself
the
prowess
and
skill
of
st
luc
and
he
knew
too
that
the
savage
persistency
of
tandakora
was
not
to
be
held
lightly
like
robert
he
gazed
long
into
the
blue
west
which
was
flecked
only
by
little
clouds
of
white
a
sign
a
sign
he
said
if
we
could
only
behold
a
sign
but
the
heavens
said
nothing
the
sun
a
huge
ball
of
glowing
copper
was
already
far
down
the
western
curve
and
the
hunters
heart
beat
hard
with
anxiety
he
felt
that
if
help
came
it
should
come
soon
but
little
water
was
left
to
the
soldiers
although
their
food
might
last
another
day
and
the
night
itself
now
not
far
away
would
bring
the
danger
of
a
new
attack
by
a
creeping
foe
greatly
superior
in
numbers
he
turned
away
from
the
cliff
but
robert
remained
and
presently
the
youth
called
in
a
sharp
thrilling
whisper
dave
dave
come
back
robert
had
continued
to
watch
the
sky
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
faint
dark
line
against
the
sea
of
blue
he
rubbed
his
eyes
fearing
it
was
a
fault
of
vision
but
the
trace
was
still
there
and
he
believed
it
to
be
smoke
dave
dave
the
signal
look
look
he
cried
the
hunter
came
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
stared
into
the
west
a
thread
of
black
lay
across
the
blue
and
his
heart
leaped
do
you
believe
that
tayoga
has
anything
to
do
with
it
asked
robert
i
do
if
it
were
our
foes
out
there
hed
have
been
back
long
since
and
since
it
may
be
friends
theyve
sent
up
this
smoke
hoping
well
divine
what
they
mean
it
looks
like
it
tayoga
is
a
sharp
lad
and
hell
want
to
put
heart
in
the
soldiers
it
must
be
the
onondaga
and
i
wish
i
knew
what
his
smoke
was
saying
captain
colden
joined
them
and
they
pointed
out
to
him
the
trace
across
the
sky
which
was
now
broadening
explaining
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
probably
a
signal
sent
up
by
tayoga
and
that
he
might
be
leading
a
force
to
their
aid
what
help
could
he
bring
asked
the
captain
willet
shook
his
head
i
cant
answer
you
there
he
replied
but
the
smoke
has
significance
for
us
of
that
i
feel
sure
by
sundown
well
know
what
it
means
and
thats
only
about
two
hours
away
said
captain
colden
whatever
happens
well
hold
out
to
the
last
i
suppose
though
that
st
lucs
force
also
will
see
the
smoke
quite
likely
replied
willet
and
the
frenchman
may
send
a
runner
too
to
see
what
it
means
but
however
good
a
runner
he
may
be
hell
be
no
match
for
tayoga
thats
sure
said
robert
so
great
was
his
confidence
in
the
onondaga
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
killed
or
taken
and
he
awaited
his
certain
return
either
with
or
without
a
helping
force
he
lay
now
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
whence
he
could
look
toward
the
west
the
point
of
hope
whenever
he
wished
ate
another
strip
of
venison
and
took
another
drink
of
water
out
of
a
friendly
canteen
the
west
was
now
blazing
with
terraces
of
red
and
yellow
rising
above
one
another
and
the
east
was
misty
gray
and
dim
twilight
was
not
far
away
the
thread
of
smoke
that
had
lain
against
the
sky
above
the
forest
was
gone
the
glittering
bar
of
red
and
gold
being
absolutely
free
from
any
trace
st
lucs
force
opened
fire
again
bullets
clipping
twigs
and
leaves
but
the
defense
lay
quiet
except
black
rifle
who
crept
back
and
forth
continually
seeking
a
target
and
pulling
the
trigger
whenever
he
found
it
the
misty
gray
in
the
east
turned
to
darkness
in
the
west
the
sun
went
down
the
slope
of
the
world
and
the
brilliant
terraces
of
color
began
to
fade
the
firing
ceased
and
another
tense
period
of
quiet
hard
to
endure
came
at
the
suggestion
of
the
hunter
colden
drew
in
his
whole
troop
near
the
cliff
and
waited
all
despite
their
weariness
and
strain
keeping
the
keenest
watch
they
could
but
robert
instead
of
looking
toward
the
east
where
st
lucs
force
was
invariably
looked
into
the
sunset
because
it
was
there
that
tayoga
had
gone
and
it
was
there
that
they
had
seen
the
smoke
of
which
they
expected
so
much
the
terraces
of
color
already
grown
dim
were
now
fading
fast
at
the
top
they
were
gone
altogether
and
they
only
lingered
low
down
but
on
the
forest
the
red
light
yet
blazed
every
twig
and
leaf
seemed
to
stand
individual
and
distinct
black
against
a
scarlet
shield
but
it
was
for
merely
a
few
minutes
then
all
the
red
glow
disappeared
like
a
great
light
going
out
suddenly
and
the
western
forest
as
well
as
the
eastern
lay
in
a
gray
gloom
it
always
seemed
to
robert
that
the
last
going
of
the
sunset
that
day
was
like
a
signal
because
when
the
night
swept
down
black
and
complete
everywhere
there
was
a
burst
of
heavy
firing
from
the
south
and
a
long
exultant
yell
no
bullet
sped
through
the
thickets
where
the
defenders
lay
and
willet
cried
tayoga
tayoga
and
help
ah
here
they
come
the
mohawks
tayoga
panting
from
exertion
sprang
into
the
bushes
among
them
and
he
was
followed
by
a
tall
figure
in
war
paint
lofty
plumes
waving
from
his
war
bonnet
behind
him
came
many
warriors
and
others
were
already
on
the
flanks
spreading
out
like
a
fan
filing
rapidly
and
shouting
the
war
whoop
robert
recognized
at
once
the
great
figure
that
stood
before
them
it
was
daganoweda
the
young
mohawk
chief
of
his
earlier
acquaintance
whom
he
had
met
both
on
the
war
path
and
at
the
great
council
of
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
had
his
been
the
right
to
choose
the
man
who
was
to
come
to
their
aid
the
mohawk
would
have
been
his
first
choice
robert
knew
his
intense
hatred
of
the
french
and
their
red
allies
and
he
also
knew
his
fierce
courage
and
great
ability
in
battle
the
soldiers
looked
in
some
alarm
at
the
painted
host
that
had
sprung
among
them
but
willet
and
robert
assured
them
insistently
that
these
were
friends
and
the
sound
of
the
battle
they
were
already
waging
on
the
flank
with
st
lucs
force
was
proof
enough
captain
colden
said
robert
not
forgetful
that
an
indian
likes
the
courtesies
of
life
and
can
take
his
compliments
thick
this
is
the
great
young
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
which
in
our
language
means
the
inexhaustible
and
such
he
is
inexhaustible
in
resource
and
courage
in
battle
and
in
loyalty
to
his
friends
daganoweda
smiled
and
extended
his
hand
in
the
white
mans
fashion
young
colden
had
the
tact
to
shake
it
heartily
at
once
and
to
say
in
english
which
the
young
mohawk
chief
understood
perfectly
daganoweda
whatever
praise
of
you
mr
lennox
has
given
its
not
half
enough
i
confess
now
although
i
would
not
have
admitted
it
before
that
if
you
had
not
come
we
should
probably
have
been
lost
he
had
made
a
friend
for
life
and
then
without
further
words
the
two
turned
to
the
battle
but
robert
remained
for
a
minute
beside
tayoga
whose
chest
was
still
heaving
with
his
great
exertions
where
did
you
find
them
he
asked
many
miles
to
the
west
lennox
after
i
descended
the
cliff
i
was
pursued
by
huron
skirmishers
and
i
had
to
shake
them
off
then
i
ran
at
full
speed
toward
the
point
where
the
smoke
had
risen
knowing
that
the
need
was
great
and
i
overtook
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
their
first
smoke
was
but
that
from
a
campfire
as
being
in
strong
force
they
did
not
care
who
saw
them
but
the
last
just
before
the
sunset
was
sent
up
as
a
signal
by
two
warriors
whom
we
left
behind
for
the
purpose
we
thought
you
might
take
it
to
mean
that
help
was
coming
and
so
we
did
how
many
warriors
has
daganoweda
fifty
and
that
is
enough
already
they
push
the
frenchman
and
his
force
before
them
come
we
must
join
them
dagaeoga
the
breath
has
come
back
into
my
body
and
i
am
a
strong
man
again
the
two
now
quickly
took
their
places
in
the
battle
in
the
night
and
the
forest
the
position
of
the
two
forces
being
reversed
the
soldiers
and
the
mohawks
were
pushing
the
combat
at
every
point
and
the
agile
warriors
extending
themselves
on
the
flanks
had
already
driven
in
st
lucs
skirmishers
black
rifle
uttering
fierce
shouts
was
leading
a
strong
attack
in
the
center
the
firing
was
now
rapid
and
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
before
flashes
of
flame
appeared
everywhere
in
the
thicket
above
the
crackle
of
rifles
and
muskets
swelled
the
long
thrilling
war
cry
of
the
mohawks
and
back
in
fierce
defiance
came
the
yells
of
the
hurons
and
abenakis
willet
joined
robert
and
the
two
with
tayoga
saw
that
the
soldiers
fought
well
under
cover
the
young
philadelphians
in
the
excitement
of
battle
and
of
a
sudden
and
triumphant
reversal
of
fortune
were
likely
to
expose
themselves
rashly
and
the
advice
of
the
forest
veterans
was
timely
captain
colden
saw
that
it
was
taken
although
two
more
of
his
men
were
slain
as
they
advanced
and
several
were
wounded
but
the
issue
was
no
longer
doubtful
the
weight
that
the
mohawks
had
suddenly
thrown
into
the
battle
was
too
great
the
force
of
st
luc
was
steadily
driven
northward
and
daganowedas
alert
skirmishers
on
the
flanks
kept
it
compressed
together
robert
knew
how
bitter
the
defeat
would
be
to
st
luc
but
the
knowledge
did
not
keep
his
exultation
from
mounting
to
a
high
pitch
st
luc
might
strive
with
all
his
might
to
keep
his
men
in
the
battle
but
the
frenchmen
could
not
be
numerous
and
it
was
the
custom
of
indians
once
a
combat
seemed
lost
to
melt
away
like
a
mist
they
believed
thoroughly
that
it
was
best
to
run
away
and
fight
another
day
and
there
was
no
disgrace
in
escaping
from
a
stricken
field
they
run
they
run
and
the
frenchmen
must
run
with
them
exclaimed
black
rifle
as
he
spoke
a
bullet
grazed
his
side
and
struck
a
soldier
behind
him
but
the
force
pressed
on
with
the
ardor
fed
by
victory
willet
did
not
try
any
longer
to
restrain
them
although
he
understood
full
well
the
danger
of
a
battle
in
the
dark
but
he
knew
that
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
experienced
in
every
forest
wile
would
guard
them
against
surprise
and
he
deemed
it
best
now
that
they
should
strike
with
all
their
might
robert
seldom
saw
any
of
the
warriors
before
him
and
he
did
not
once
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
frenchman
whenever
his
rifle
was
loaded
he
fired
at
a
flitting
form
never
knowing
whether
or
not
his
bullet
struck
true
and
glad
of
his
ignorance
his
sensitive
and
imaginative
mind
became
greatly
excited
the
flashes
of
flame
in
the
thickets
were
multiplied
a
hundred
fold
a
thousand
little
pulses
beat
heavily
in
his
temples
and
the
shouts
of
the
savages
seemed
to
fill
the
forest
but
he
pressed
on
conscious
that
the
enemy
was
disappearing
before
them
in
his
eagerness
he
passed
ahead
of
willet
and
tayoga
and
came
very
near
to
st
lucs
retreating
line
his
foot
became
entangled
in
trailing
vines
and
he
fell
but
he
was
up
in
an
instant
and
he
fired
at
a
shadowy
figure
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
advance
in
his
haste
he
missed
and
the
figure
turning
raised
a
rifle
there
was
a
fair
moonlight
and
robert
saw
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
bearing
directly
upon
him
and
he
knew
too
that
the
rifle
was
held
by
firm
hands
his
vivid
and
sensitive
imagination
at
once
leaped
into
intense
life
his
own
weapon
was
empty
and
his
last
moment
had
come
he
saw
the
strong
brown
hands
holding
the
rifle
and
then
his
gaze
passed
on
to
the
face
of
st
luc
he
saw
the
blue
eyes
of
the
frenchman
as
they
looked
down
the
sights
open
wide
in
a
kind
of
horror
then
he
abruptly
dropped
the
muzzle
waved
one
hand
to
robert
and
vanished
in
the
thickets
and
the
darkness
the
battle
was
over
there
were
a
few
dying
shots
scattered
beads
of
flame
an
occasional
shout
of
triumph
from
the
mohawks
a
defiant
yell
or
two
in
reply
from
the
hurons
and
the
abenakis
and
then
the
trail
of
the
combat
swept
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
robert
who
stood
dazed
and
yet
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
st
luc
had
held
his
life
upon
the
pressure
of
a
trigger
and
the
trigger
would
have
been
pulled
had
he
not
seen
before
it
was
too
late
who
stood
before
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
the
moonlight
was
enough
for
robert
to
see
that
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
when
he
recognized
the
target
and
then
the
weapon
had
been
turned
away
and
he
had
gone
like
a
flash
why
for
what
reason
had
st
luc
spared
him
in
the
heat
and
fury
of
a
desperate
and
losing
battle
it
must
have
been
a
powerful
motive
for
a
man
to
stay
his
bullet
at
such
a
time
wake
up
lad
wake
up
the
battle
has
been
won
willets
heavy
but
friendly
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
and
robert
came
out
of
his
daze
he
decided
at
once
that
he
would
say
nothing
about
the
meeting
with
st
luc
and
merely
remarked
in
a
cryptic
manner
i
was
stunned
for
a
moment
by
a
bullet
that
did
not
hit
me
yes
weve
won
dave
thanks
to
the
mohawks
thanks
to
daganoweda
and
his
brave
mohawks
and
to
tayoga
and
to
the
gallant
captain
colden
and
his
gallant
men
all
of
us
together
have
made
the
triumph
possible
i
understand
that
the
bodies
of
only
two
frenchmen
have
been
found
and
that
neither
was
that
of
st
luc
well
im
glad
that
frenchman
will
do
us
great
damage
in
this
war
but
hes
an
honorable
foe
and
a
man
of
heart
and
i
like
him
a
man
of
heart
yes
truly
none
knew
it
better
than
robert
but
again
he
kept
his
own
counsel
he
too
was
glad
that
his
had
not
been
one
of
the
two
french
bodies
found
but
there
was
still
danger
from
the
pursuing
mohawks
who
would
hang
on
tenaciously
and
he
felt
a
sudden
thrill
of
alarm
but
it
passed
as
he
remembered
that
the
chevalier
was
a
woodsman
of
experience
and
surpassing
skill
tayoga
came
back
to
them
somewhat
blown
he
had
followed
the
fleeing
french
and
indian
force
two
or
three
miles
but
there
was
a
limit
even
to
his
nerves
and
sinews
of
wrought
steel
he
had
already
run
thirty
miles
before
joining
in
the
combat
and
now
it
was
time
to
rest
come
tayoga
said
the
hunter
well
go
back
to
the
ground
our
lads
have
defended
so
well
and
eat
drink
and
sleep
the
mohawks
will
attend
to
all
the
work
thats
left
which
isnt
much
weve
earned
our
repose
captain
colden
slightly
wounded
in
the
arm
appeared
and
willet
gave
him
the
high
compliments
that
he
and
his
soldiers
deserved
he
told
him
it
was
seldom
that
men
unused
to
the
woods
bore
themselves
so
well
in
an
indian
fight
but
the
young
captain
modestly
disclaimed
the
chief
merit
replying
that
he
and
his
detachment
would
surely
have
been
lost
had
it
not
been
for
willet
and
his
comrades
then
they
went
back
to
the
ground
near
the
cliff
where
they
had
made
their
great
fight
and
willet
although
the
night
was
warm
wisely
had
a
large
fire
built
he
knew
the
psychological
and
stimulating
effect
of
heat
and
light
upon
the
lads
of
the
city
who
had
passed
through
such
a
fearful
ordeal
in
the
dark
and
indianhaunted
forest
he
encouraged
them
to
throw
on
more
dead
boughs
until
the
blaze
leaped
higher
and
higher
and
sparkled
and
roared
sending
up
myriads
of
joyous
sparks
that
glowed
for
their
brief
lives
among
the
trees
and
then
died
no
fear
of
st
luc
and
the
indians
now
that
fierce
fringe
of
mohawks
was
a
barrier
that
they
could
never
pass
even
should
they
choose
to
return
and
no
such
choice
could
possibly
be
theirs
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
in
increasing
volume
and
the
philadelphia
lads
recovering
from
the
collapse
that
had
followed
tremendous
exertions
and
excitement
began
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
their
victory
and
to
talk
eagerly
with
one
another
but
the
period
of
full
rest
had
not
yet
come
captain
colden
made
them
dig
with
their
bayonets
shallow
graves
for
their
dead
six
in
number
fluent
of
speech
his
sensitive
mind
again
fitting
into
the
deep
gravity
of
the
situation
robert
said
a
few
words
above
them
words
that
he
felt
words
that
moved
those
who
heard
then
the
earth
was
thrown
in
and
stones
and
heavy
boughs
were
placed
over
all
to
keep
away
the
digging
wolves
or
other
wild
animals
the
wounded
were
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
before
the
fire
and
in
the
light
of
the
brilliant
flames
the
awe
created
by
the
dead
quickly
passed
food
was
served
and
fresh
water
was
drunk
the
canteens
being
refilled
from
a
spring
that
tayoga
found
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
the
soldiers
save
six
who
had
been
posted
as
guard
stretched
themselves
on
grass
or
leaves
and
fell
asleep
one
by
one
tayoga
who
had
made
the
greatest
physical
effort
followed
them
to
the
land
of
slumber
but
captain
colden
sat
and
talked
with
robert
and
willet
although
it
was
now
far
past
midnight
the
bushes
parted
and
a
dark
figure
making
no
sound
as
it
came
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
it
was
black
rifle
and
his
eyes
still
glittered
but
he
said
nothing
robert
thought
he
saw
upon
his
face
a
look
of
intense
satisfaction
and
once
more
he
shuddered
a
little
the
man
lay
down
with
his
rifle
beside
him
and
fell
asleep
his
hands
still
clutching
his
weapon
before
dawn
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
came
back
also
and
robert
in
behalf
of
them
all
thanked
the
young
chief
in
the
purest
mohawk
and
with
the
fine
phrasing
and
apt
allegory
so
dear
to
the
indian
heart
daganoweda
made
a
fitting
reply
saying
that
the
merit
did
not
belong
to
him
but
to
manitou
and
then
leaving
a
half
dozen
of
his
warriors
to
join
in
the
watch
he
and
the
others
slept
before
the
fire
it
was
well
that
you
played
so
strongly
upon
the
feelings
of
the
mohawks
at
that
test
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
robert
said
willet
if
you
had
not
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
quebec
of
the
french
was
once
the
stadacona
of
the
mohawks
they
would
not
have
been
here
tonight
to
save
us
they
say
that
deeds
speak
louder
than
words
but
when
the
same
man
speaks
with
both
words
and
deeds
people
have
got
to
hear
you
give
me
too
much
credit
dave
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
mohawk
attack
upon
the
french
aye
lad
but
one
had
to
see
a
chance
and
use
it
now
join
all
those
fellows
in
sleep
we
wont
move
before
noon
but
roberts
brain
was
too
active
for
sleep
just
yet
while
his
imaginative
power
made
him
see
things
before
other
people
saw
them
he
also
continued
to
see
them
after
they
were
gone
the
wilderness
battle
passed
once
more
before
him
and
when
he
brushed
his
eyes
to
thrust
it
away
he
looked
at
the
sleeping
mohawks
and
thought
what
splendid
savages
they
were
the
other
tribes
of
the
hodenosaunee
were
still
holding
to
their
neutralityall
that
was
asked
of
thembut
the
mohawks
with
the
memories
of
their
ancient
wrongs
burning
in
their
hearts
had
openly
taken
the
side
of
the
english
and
tonight
their
valor
and
skill
had
undoubtedly
saved
the
american
force
daganoweda
was
a
hero
and
so
was
tayoga
the
onondaga
always
the
first
of
red
men
to
robert
his
heated
brain
began
to
grow
cool
at
last
the
vivid
pictures
that
had
been
passing
so
fast
before
his
eyes
faded
he
saw
only
reality
the
blazing
fire
the
dusky
figures
lying
motionless
before
it
and
the
circling
wall
of
dark
woods
then
he
slept
willet
was
the
only
white
man
who
remained
awake
he
saw
the
great
fire
die
and
the
dawn
come
in
its
place
he
felt
then
for
the
first
time
in
all
that
long
encounter
the
strangeness
of
his
own
position
the
wilderness
savages
and
forest
battle
had
become
natural
to
him
and
yet
his
life
had
once
been
far
different
there
was
a
taste
of
a
distant
past
in
that
fierce
duel
at
quebec
when
he
slew
the
bravo
boucher
a
deed
for
which
he
had
never
felt
a
moments
regret
and
yet
when
he
balanced
the
old
times
against
the
present
he
could
not
say
which
had
the
advantage
he
had
found
true
friends
in
the
woods
men
who
would
and
did
risk
their
own
lives
to
save
his
the
dawn
came
swiftly
flooding
the
earth
with
light
daganoweda
and
many
of
the
mohawk
warriors
awoke
but
the
young
philadelphia
captain
and
his
men
slept
on
plunged
in
the
utter
stupor
of
exhaustion
tayoga
who
had
made
a
supreme
effort
both
physical
and
mental
also
continued
to
sleep
and
robert
lying
with
his
feet
to
the
coals
never
stirred
daganoweda
shook
himself
and
so
shaking
shook
the
last
shred
of
sleep
from
his
eyes
then
he
looked
with
pride
at
his
warriors
those
who
yet
lay
upon
the
ground
and
those
who
had
arisen
he
was
a
young
chief
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
and
he
was
the
bloom
and
flower
of
mohawk
courage
and
daring
his
name
daganoweda
the
inexhaustible
was
fully
deserved
as
his
bravery
and
resource
were
unlimited
but
unlike
tayoga
he
had
in
him
none
of
the
priestly
quality
he
had
not
drunk
or
even
sipped
at
the
white
mans
civilization
the
spirituality
so
often
to
be
found
in
the
onondagas
was
unknown
to
him
he
was
a
warrior
first
last
and
all
the
time
he
was
daganoweda
of
the
clan
of
the
turtle
of
the
nation
ganeagaono
the
keepers
of
the
eastern
gate
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
he
craved
no
glory
save
that
to
be
won
in
battle
which
he
craved
all
the
time
daganoweda
as
he
looked
at
his
men
felt
intense
satisfaction
because
the
achievement
of
his
mohawks
the
night
before
had
been
brilliant
and
successful
but
he
concealed
it
from
all
save
himself
it
was
not
for
a
chief
who
wished
to
win
not
one
victory
but
a
hundred
to
show
undue
elation
but
he
turned
and
for
a
few
moments
gazed
directly
into
the
sun
with
unwinking
eyes
and
when
he
shifted
his
gaze
away
a
great
tide
of
life
leaped
in
his
veins
then
he
gave
silent
thanks
like
all
the
other
indians
in
north
america
the
mohawks
personified
and
worshipped
the
sun
which
to
them
was
the
mighty
dweller
in
heaven
almost
the
same
as
manitou
a
great
spirit
to
whom
sacrifices
and
thanksgivings
were
to
be
made
the
sun
an
immortal
being
had
risen
that
morning
and
from
his
seat
in
the
highest
of
the
high
heavens
he
had
looked
down
with
his
invincible
eye
which
no
man
could
face
more
than
a
few
seconds
upon
his
favorite
children
the
mohawks
to
whom
he
had
given
the
victory
daganoweda
bowed
a
head
naturally
haughty
and
under
his
breath
murmured
thanks
for
the
triumph
given
and
prayers
for
others
to
come
the
warriors
built
the
fire
anew
and
cooked
their
breakfasts
they
had
venison
and
hominy
of
three
kinds
according
to
the
corn
of
which
it
was
made
onaogaant
or
the
white
corn
ticne
or
the
red
corn
and
hagowa
or
the
white
flint
corn
they
also
had
bear
meat
and
dried
beans
so
their
breakfast
was
abundant
and
they
ate
with
the
appetite
of
warriors
who
had
done
mighty
deeds
daganoweda
and
willet
as
became
great
men
sat
together
on
a
log
and
were
served
by
a
warrior
who
took
honor
from
the
task
black
rifle
sat
alone
a
little
distance
away
he
would
have
been
welcome
in
the
company
of
the
mohawk
chief
and
the
hunter
but
brooding
and
solitary
in
mind
he
wished
to
be
alone
and
they
knew
and
respected
his
wish
daganoweda
glanced
at
him
more
than
once
as
he
remained
in
silence
and
always
there
was
pity
in
his
looks
and
there
was
admiration
too
because
black
rifle
was
a
great
warrior
the
woods
held
none
greater
when
robert
awoke
it
was
well
on
toward
noon
and
he
sprang
up
refreshed
and
strong
youve
had
quite
a
nap
robert
said
willet
who
had
not
slept
at
all
but
some
of
the
soldiers
are
still
sleeping
and
tayoga
has
just
gone
down
to
the
spring
to
bathe
his
face
which
i
also
will
do
said
robert
and
when
you
come
back
food
will
be
ready
for
you
robert
found
tayoga
at
the
spring
flexing
his
muscles
and
taking
short
steps
back
and
forth
it
was
a
great
run
you
made
said
the
white
youth
and
it
saved
us
theres
no
stiffness
i
hope
there
was
a
little
dagaeoga
but
i
have
worked
it
out
of
my
body
now
all
my
muscles
are
as
they
were
i
am
ready
to
make
another
and
equal
run
its
not
needed
and
for
that
im
thankful
st
luc
will
not
come
back
nor
will
tandakora
i
think
linger
in
the
woods
hoping
for
a
shot
he
knows
that
the
mohawk
skirmishers
will
be
too
vigilant
as
they
went
back
to
the
fire
for
their
food
they
heard
a
droning
song
and
the
regular
beat
of
feet
some
of
the
mohawks
were
dancing
the
buffalo
dance
a
dance
named
after
an
animal
never
found
in
their
country
but
which
they
knew
well
it
was
a
tribute
to
the
vast
energy
and
daring
of
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
that
they
should
range
in
such
remote
regions
as
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
hunt
the
buffalo
with
the
cherokees
who
came
up
from
the
south
they
called
the
dance
dageyagooanno
and
it
was
always
danced
by
men
only
one
warrior
beat
upon
the
drum
ganojoo
and
another
used
gusdawasa
or
the
rattle
made
of
the
shell
of
a
squash
a
dozen
warriors
danced
and
players
and
dancers
alike
sang
it
was
a
most
singular
dance
and
robert
as
he
ate
and
drank
watched
it
with
curious
interest
the
warriors
capered
back
and
forth
and
often
they
bent
themselves
far
over
until
their
hands
touched
the
ground
then
they
would
arch
their
backs
until
they
formed
a
kind
of
hump
and
they
leaped
to
and
fro
bellowing
all
the
time
the
imitation
was
that
of
a
buffalo
recognizable
at
once
and
while
it
was
rude
and
monotonous
both
dancing
and
singing
preserved
a
rhythm
and
as
one
listened
continuously
it
soon
crept
into
the
blood
robert
with
that
singular
temperament
of
his
so
receptive
to
all
impressions
began
to
feel
it
their
chant
was
of
war
and
victory
and
he
stirred
to
both
he
was
on
the
warpath
with
them
and
he
passed
with
them
through
the
thick
of
battle
they
danced
for
a
long
time
quitting
only
when
exhaustion
compelled
by
that
time
all
the
soldiers
were
awake
and
captain
colden
talked
with
the
other
leaders
red
and
white
his
instructions
took
him
farther
west
where
he
was
to
build
a
fort
for
the
defense
of
the
border
and
staunch
and
true
he
did
not
mean
to
turn
back
because
he
had
been
in
desperate
battle
with
the
french
and
their
indian
allies
i
was
sent
to
protect
a
section
of
the
frontier
he
said
to
willet
and
while
ive
found
it
hard
to
protect
my
men
and
myself
yet
i
must
go
on
i
could
never
return
to
philadelphia
and
face
our
people
there
its
a
just
view
you
take
captain
colden
said
willet
i
feel
though
that
my
men
and
i
are
but
children
in
the
woods
yesterday
and
last
night
proved
it
if
you
and
your
friends
continue
with
us
our
march
may
not
be
in
vain
willet
glanced
at
robert
and
then
at
tayoga
ours
for
the
present
at
least
is
a
roving
commission
said
young
lennox
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
go
with
captain
colden
i
am
not
called
back
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
said
tayoga
i
would
see
the
building
of
this
fort
that
captain
colden
has
planned
then
we
three
are
agreed
said
the
hunter
its
best
not
to
speak
to
black
rifle
because
hell
follow
his
own
notions
anyway
and
as
for
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
i
think
theyre
likely
to
resume
their
march
northward
against
the
french
border
im
grateful
to
you
three
said
captain
colden
and
now
that
its
settled
well
start
as
soon
as
we
can
better
give
them
all
a
good
rest
and
wait
until
the
morning
said
the
hunter
again
captain
colden
agreed
with
him
chapter
iv
the
perilous
path
after
a
long
night
of
sleep
and
rest
the
little
troop
resumed
its
march
the
next
morning
the
wounded
fortunately
were
not
hurt
so
badly
that
they
could
not
limp
along
with
the
others
and
while
the
surgery
of
the
soldiers
was
rude
it
was
effective
nevertheless
daganoweda
as
they
had
expected
prepared
to
leave
them
for
a
raid
toward
the
st
lawrence
but
he
said
rather
grimly
that
he
might
return
in
a
month
perhaps
he
knew
where
they
were
going
to
build
their
fort
and
unless
corlear
and
all
the
other
british
governors
awoke
much
earlier
in
the
morning
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
young
captain
from
philadelphia
would
need
the
help
of
the
mohawks
again
then
daganoweda
said
farewell
to
robert
tayoga
willet
and
black
rifle
addressing
each
according
to
his
quality
them
he
trusted
he
knew
them
to
be
great
warriors
and
daring
rovers
of
the
wilderness
he
had
no
advice
for
them
because
he
knew
they
did
not
need
it
but
he
expected
them
to
be
his
comrades
often
in
the
great
war
and
he
wished
them
well
to
tayoga
he
said
you
and
i
oh
young
chief
of
the
onondagas
have
hearts
that
beat
alike
the
onondagas
do
well
to
keep
aloof
from
the
white
mans
quarrels
for
the
present
and
to
sit
at
peace
though
watchful
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
your
hopes
are
with
our
friends
the
english
and
you
in
person
fight
for
them
we
mohawks
know
whom
to
hate
we
know
that
the
french
have
robbed
us
more
than
any
others
we
know
that
their
quebec
is
our
stadacona
so
we
have
dug
up
the
tomahawk
and
last
night
we
showed
to
sharp
sword
and
his
men
and
tandakora
the
ojibway
how
we
could
use
it
sharp
sword
was
the
iroquois
name
for
st
luc
who
had
already
proved
his
great
ability
and
daring
as
a
forest
leader
the
ganeagaono
are
now
the
chief
barrier
against
the
french
and
their
tribes
said
tayoga
the
brilliant
eyes
of
daganoweda
glittered
in
his
dark
face
he
knew
that
tayoga
would
not
pay
the
mohawks
so
high
a
compliment
unless
he
meant
it
tayoga
he
said
we
belong
to
the
leading
nations
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
you
to
the
onundahgaono
and
i
to
the
ganeagaono
you
are
first
in
the
council
and
we
are
first
on
the
warpath
it
was
tododaho
the
onondaga
who
first
formed
the
great
league
and
it
was
hayowentha
the
mohawk
who
combed
the
snakes
out
of
his
hair
and
who
strengthened
it
and
who
helped
him
to
build
it
so
firmly
that
it
shall
last
forever
brothers
are
we
and
always
shall
be
he
touched
his
forehead
in
salute
and
the
onondaga
touched
his
in
reply
aye
brothers
are
we
he
said
mohawk
and
onondaga
onondaga
and
mohawk
the
great
war
of
the
white
kings
which
draws
us
in
it
has
come
but
i
know
that
hayowentha
watches
over
his
people
and
tododaho
over
his
in
the
spring
when
i
went
forth
in
the
night
to
fight
the
hurons
i
gazed
off
there
in
the
west
where
shines
the
great
star
on
which
tododaho
makes
his
home
and
i
saw
him
looking
down
upon
me
and
casting
about
me
the
veil
of
his
protection
daganoweda
looked
up
at
the
gleaming
blue
of
the
heavens
and
his
eyes
glittered
again
he
believed
every
word
that
tayoga
said
as
tododaho
watches
over
you
so
hayowentha
watches
over
me
he
said
and
he
will
bring
me
back
in
safety
and
victory
from
the
st
lawrence
farewell
again
my
brother
farewell
once
more
daganoweda
the
mohawk
chief
plunged
into
the
forest
and
his
fifty
warriors
followed
him
like
a
shadow
they
were
gone
and
the
waving
bushes
gave
back
no
sign
that
they
had
ever
been
captain
colden
rubbed
his
eyes
and
then
laughed
i
never
knew
men
to
vanish
so
swiftly
before
he
said
but
last
night
was
good
proof
that
they
were
here
and
that
they
came
in
time
i
suppose
its
about
the
only
victory
of
which
we
can
make
boast
he
spoke
the
full
truth
from
the
st
lawrence
to
the
ohio
the
border
was
already
ravaged
with
fire
and
sword
appeals
for
help
were
pouring
in
from
the
distant
settlements
and
the
governors
of
new
york
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
france
had
struck
the
first
blow
and
she
had
struck
hard
young
washington
defeated
by
overwhelming
numbers
was
going
back
to
virginia
and
duquesne
the
fort
of
the
french
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
and
allegheny
was
a
powerful
rallying
place
for
their
own
forces
and
the
swarming
indian
bands
pouring
out
of
the
wilderness
drawn
by
the
tales
of
unlimited
scalps
and
plunder
the
task
before
captain
coldens
slender
force
was
full
of
danger
his
numbers
might
have
been
five
times
as
great
and
then
they
would
not
have
been
too
many
to
build
and
hold
the
fort
he
was
sent
to
build
and
hold
but
he
had
no
thought
of
turning
back
and
as
soon
as
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
were
gone
they
started
bending
their
course
somewhat
farther
toward
the
south
at
the
ford
of
a
river
twenty
men
with
horses
carrying
food
ammunition
and
other
supplies
were
to
meet
them
and
they
reckoned
that
they
could
reach
it
by
midnight
the
men
with
the
horses
had
been
sent
from
another
point
and
it
was
not
thought
then
that
there
was
any
danger
of
french
and
indian
attack
before
the
junction
was
made
but
the
colonial
authorities
had
reckoned
without
the
vigor
and
daring
of
st
luc
now
the
most
cruel
fears
assailed
young
captain
colden
and
robert
and
the
hunter
could
not
find
much
argument
to
remove
them
it
was
possible
that
the
second
force
had
been
ambushed
also
and
if
so
it
had
certainly
been
destroyed
being
capable
of
no
such
resistance
as
that
made
by
coldens
men
and
without
the
aid
of
the
three
friends
and
the
mohawks
and
if
the
supplies
were
gone
the
expedition
would
be
useless
dont
be
downhearted
about
it
captain
said
willet
you
say
theres
not
a
man
in
the
party
who
knows
anything
about
the
wilderness
and
that
theyve
got
just
enough
woods
sense
to
take
them
to
the
ford
well
that
has
its
saving
grace
because
now
and
then
the
lord
seems
to
watch
over
fool
men
the
best
of
hunters
are
trapped
sometimes
in
the
forest
when
fellows
who
dont
know
a
deer
from
a
beaver
go
through
em
without
harm
then
if
theres
any
virtue
in
what
you
say
well
pray
that
these
men
are
the
biggest
fools
who
ever
lived
smoke
smoke
again
called
robert
cheerily
pointing
straight
ahead
sure
enough
that
long
dark
thread
appeared
once
more
now
against
the
western
sky
willet
laughed
theyre
the
biggest
fools
in
the
forest
just
as
you
hoped
captain
he
said
and
theyve
taken
no
more
harm
than
if
they
had
built
their
fires
in
a
philadelphia
street
theyve
set
themselves
down
for
the
night
as
peaceful
and
happy
as
you
please
if
that
isnt
the
campfire
of
your
men
with
the
pack
horses
then
ill
eat
my
cap
captain
colden
laughed
but
it
was
the
slightly
hysterical
laugh
of
relief
he
was
bent
upon
doing
his
task
and
since
the
lord
had
carried
him
so
far
through
a
mighty
danger
the
disappointment
of
losing
the
supplies
would
have
been
almost
too
much
to
bear
youre
sure
its
they
mr
willet
he
said
of
course
didnt
i
tell
you
it
wasnt
possible
for
another
such
party
of
fools
to
be
here
in
the
wilderness
and
that
the
god
of
the
white
man
and
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
taking
pity
on
their
simplicity
and
innocence
have
protected
them
i
like
to
think
what
you
say
is
true
mr
willet
its
true
be
not
afraid
that
it
isnt
now
i
think
wed
better
stop
here
and
let
robert
and
tayoga
go
ahead
spy
em
out
and
make
signals
it
would
be
just
like
em
to
blaze
away
at
us
the
moment
they
saw
the
bushes
move
with
our
coming
captain
colden
was
glad
to
take
his
advice
and
the
white
youth
and
the
red
went
forward
silently
through
the
forest
hearing
the
sound
of
cheerful
voices
as
they
drew
near
to
the
campfire
which
was
a
large
one
blazing
brightly
they
also
heard
the
sound
of
horses
moving
and
they
knew
that
the
detachment
had
taken
no
harm
tayoga
parted
the
bushes
and
peered
forth
look
he
said
surely
they
are
watched
over
by
manitou
about
twenty
men
or
rather
boys
for
all
of
them
were
very
young
were
standing
or
lying
about
a
fire
a
tall
very
ruddy
youth
in
the
uniform
of
a
colonial
lieutenant
was
speaking
to
them
didnt
i
tell
you
lads
he
said
there
wasnt
an
indian
nearer
than
fort
duquesne
and
thats
a
long
way
from
here
weve
come
a
great
distance
and
not
a
foe
has
appeared
anywhere
it
may
be
that
the
french
vanish
when
they
hear
this
valiant
quaker
troop
is
coming
but
its
my
own
personal
opinion
theyll
stay
pretty
well
back
in
the
west
with
their
red
allies
the
youth
although
he
called
himself
so
did
not
look
much
like
a
quaker
to
robert
he
had
a
frank
face
and
merry
eyes
and
manner
and
voice
indicated
a
tendency
to
gayety
judging
from
his
words
he
had
no
cares
and
indians
and
ambush
were
far
from
his
thoughts
proof
of
this
was
the
absence
of
sentinels
the
men
scattered
about
the
fire
were
eating
their
suppers
and
the
horses
forty
in
number
were
grazing
in
an
open
space
it
all
looked
like
a
great
picnic
and
the
effect
was
heightened
by
the
youth
of
the
soldiers
as
the
great
bear
truly
said
whispered
tayoga
manitou
has
watched
over
them
the
forest
does
not
hold
easier
game
for
the
taking
and
had
tandakora
known
that
they
were
here
he
would
have
come
seeking
revenge
for
his
loss
in
the
attack
upon
captain
coldens
troop
youre
right
as
usual
tayoga
and
now
wed
better
hail
them
but
dont
you
come
forward
just
yet
they
dont
know
the
difference
between
indians
and
likely
your
welcome
would
be
a
bullet
i
will
wait
said
tayoga
i
tell
you
carson
the
young
lieutenant
was
saying
in
an
oratorical
manner
that
they
magnify
the
dangers
of
the
wilderness
the
ford
at
which
we
were
to
meet
colden
is
just
ahead
and
weve
come
straight
to
it
without
the
slightest
mishap
colden
is
no
sluggard
and
he
should
be
here
in
the
morning
at
the
latest
do
you
find
anything
wrong
with
my
reasoning
hugh
naught
william
replied
the
other
who
seemed
to
be
second
in
command
your
logic
is
both
precise
and
beautiful
the
dangers
of
the
border
are
greatly
exaggerated
and
as
soon
as
we
get
together
a
good
force
all
these
french
and
indians
will
flee
back
to
canada
ah
who
is
this
both
he
and
his
chief
turned
and
faced
the
woods
in
astonishment
a
youth
had
stepped
forth
and
stood
in
full
view
he
was
taller
than
either
but
younger
dressed
completely
in
deerskin
although
superior
in
cut
and
quality
to
that
of
the
ordinary
borderer
his
complexion
fair
beneath
his
tan
and
his
hair
light
he
gazed
at
them
steadily
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
both
the
first
lieutenant
and
the
second
lieutenant
of
the
quaker
troop
saw
that
he
was
no
common
person
who
are
you
repeated
william
wilton
who
was
the
first
lieutenant
who
are
you
repeated
hugh
carson
who
was
the
second
lieutenant
my
name
is
robert
lennox
replied
the
young
stranger
in
a
mellow
voice
of
amazing
quality
and
you
i
suppose
are
lieutenant
william
wilton
the
commander
of
this
little
troop
he
spoke
directly
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
replied
impressed
as
much
by
the
youths
voice
as
he
was
by
his
appearance
yes
such
is
my
name
but
how
did
you
know
it
i
dont
recall
ever
having
met
you
before
which
doubtless
is
my
loss
i
heard
it
from
an
associate
of
yours
your
chief
in
command
captain
james
colden
and
i
am
here
with
a
message
from
him
and
so
colden
is
coming
up
well
we
beat
him
to
the
place
of
meeting
weve
triumphed
with
ease
over
the
hardships
of
the
wilderness
yes
you
arrived
first
but
he
was
delayed
by
a
matter
of
importance
a
problem
that
had
to
be
solved
before
he
could
resume
his
march
you
speak
in
riddles
sir
perhaps
i
do
for
the
present
but
i
shall
soon
make
full
explanations
i
wish
to
call
first
a
friend
of
mine
an
indianalthough
you
say
there
are
no
indians
in
the
foresta
most
excellent
friend
of
ours
tayoga
come
the
onondaga
appeared
silently
in
the
circle
of
light
a
splendid
primeval
figure
drawn
to
the
uttermost
of
his
great
height
his
lofty
gaze
meeting
that
of
wilton
half
in
challenge
and
half
in
greeting
robert
had
been
an
impressive
figure
but
tayoga
owing
to
the
difference
in
race
was
even
more
so
the
hands
of
several
of
the
soldiers
moved
towards
their
weapons
did
i
not
tell
you
that
he
was
a
friend
a
most
excellent
friend
of
ours
said
robert
sharply
who
raises
a
hand
against
him
raises
a
hand
against
me
also
and
above
all
raises
a
hand
against
our
cause
lieutenant
wilton
this
is
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
is
a
prince
as
much
a
prince
as
any
in
europe
his
mind
and
his
valor
have
both
been
expended
freely
in
our
service
and
they
will
be
expended
with
equal
freedom
again
roberts
tone
was
so
sharp
and
commanding
that
wilton
impressed
by
it
saluted
the
onondaga
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
tayoga
bowed
gravely
in
reply
youre
correct
in
assuming
that
my
name
is
wilton
said
the
young
lieutenant
im
william
wilton
of
philadelphia
and
i
beg
to
present
my
second
in
command
hugh
carson
of
the
same
city
he
looked
questioningly
at
robert
who
promptly
responded
my
name
is
lennox
robert
lennox
and
i
can
claim
either
albany
or
new
york
as
a
home
i
think
ive
heard
of
you
said
wilton
a
rumor
came
to
philadelphia
about
a
man
of
that
name
going
to
quebec
on
an
errand
for
the
governor
of
new
york
i
was
the
messenger
said
robert
but
since
the
mission
was
a
failure
it
may
as
well
be
forgotten
but
it
will
not
be
forgotten
ive
heard
that
you
bore
yourself
with
great
judgment
and
address
nevertheless
if
your
modesty
forbids
the
subject
well
come
back
to
another
more
pressing
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
captain
coldens
delay
was
due
to
the
solution
of
a
vexing
problem
it
had
to
do
with
indians
who
you
say
are
not
to
be
found
in
these
forests
i
could
not
help
overhearing
you
as
i
approached
your
camp
wilton
reddened
and
then
his
generous
impulse
and
sense
of
truth
came
to
his
aid
ill
admit
that
im
careless
and
that
my
knowledge
may
be
small
he
exclaimed
but
tell
me
the
facts
mr
lennox
i
judge
by
your
face
that
events
of
grave
importance
have
occurred
captain
colden
far
east
of
this
point
was
attacked
by
a
strong
force
of
french
and
indians
under
the
renowned
partisan
leader
st
luc
tayoga
david
willet
the
hunter
the
famous
ranger
black
rifle
and
i
were
able
to
warn
him
and
give
him
some
help
but
even
then
we
should
have
been
overborne
and
destroyed
had
not
a
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
and
a
formidable
band
come
to
our
aid
united
we
defeated
st
luc
and
drove
him
northward
captain
colden
lost
several
of
his
men
but
with
the
rest
he
is
now
marching
to
the
junction
with
you
wiltons
face
turned
gray
but
in
a
moment
or
two
his
eyes
brightened
then
a
special
providence
has
been
watching
over
us
he
said
we
havent
seen
or
heard
of
an
indian
his
tone
was
one
of
mingled
relief
and
humor
and
robert
could
not
keep
from
laughing
at
all
events
he
said
you
are
safe
for
the
present
ill
remain
with
you
while
tayoga
goes
back
for
captain
colden
if
youll
be
so
good
said
wilton
who
did
not
forget
his
manners
despite
the
circumstances
ive
begun
to
feel
that
we
have
more
eyes
or
at
least
better
ones
with
you
among
us
where
is
that
indian
you
dont
mean
to
say
hes
gone
robert
laughed
again
tayoga
after
his
fashion
had
vanished
in
silence
hes
well
on
his
way
to
captain
colden
now
he
said
exaggerating
a
little
for
the
sake
of
effect
hell
be
a
great
chief
some
day
and
meanwhile
hes
the
fastest
runner
in
the
whole
six
nations
colden
and
his
troop
arrived
soon
and
the
two
little
commands
were
united
to
the
great
joy
of
all
lieutenant
wilton
had
passed
from
the
extreme
of
confidence
to
the
utmost
distrust
where
it
had
not
been
possible
for
an
indian
to
exist
he
now
saw
a
scalplock
in
every
bush
on
my
honor
he
said
to
colden
james
i
was
never
before
in
my
life
so
happy
to
see
you
im
glad
you
have
the
entire
command
now
as
mr
lennox
said
providence
saved
me
so
far
but
perhaps
it
wouldnt
lend
a
helping
hand
any
longer
the
pack
horses
carried
surgical
supplies
for
the
wounded
and
willet
and
black
rifle
were
skillful
in
using
them
all
of
the
hurt
they
were
sure
would
be
well
again
within
a
week
and
there
was
little
to
mar
the
general
feeling
of
high
spirits
that
prevailed
in
the
camp
wilton
and
carson
were
lads
of
mettle
full
of
talk
of
philadelphia
then
the
greatest
city
in
the
british
colonies
and
related
to
most
of
its
leading
families
as
was
colden
too
his
family
being
a
branch
of
the
new
york
family
of
that
name
robert
was
at
home
with
them
at
once
and
they
were
eager
to
hear
from
him
about
quebec
and
the
latest
fashions
of
the
french
already
the
arbiters
of
fashion
and
recognized
as
such
despite
the
war
between
them
by
english
and
americans
i
had
hoped
to
go
to
quebec
myself
said
wilton
reflectively
but
i
suppose
its
a
visit
thats
delayed
for
a
long
time
now
how
does
it
happen
that
you
a
quaker
are
second
in
command
here
asked
robert
it
must
be
the
belligerency
repressed
through
three
or
four
generations
and
breaking
out
at
last
in
me
replied
wilton
his
eyes
twinkling
i
suppose
theres
just
so
much
fighting
in
every
family
and
if
three
or
four
generations
in
succession
are
peaceful
the
next
that
follows
is
likely
to
be
full
of
warlike
fury
so
as
soon
as
the
war
began
i
started
for
it
its
not
inherent
in
me
as
i
said
its
the
confined
ardor
of
generations
bursting
forth
suddenly
in
my
person
im
not
an
active
agent
im
merely
an
instrument
it
was
the
same
warlike
fury
that
caused
you
to
come
here
build
your
fire
and
set
no
watch
expecting
the
woods
to
be
as
peaceful
as
philadelphia
said
colden
wilton
colored
i
didnt
dream
the
french
and
indians
were
so
near
he
replied
apologetically
if
comparisons
are
valuable
you
neednt
feel
any
mortification
about
it
will
said
colden
i
was
just
about
as
careless
myself
and
all
of
us
would
have
lost
our
scalps
if
willet
lennox
and
tayoga
hadnt
come
along
wilton
was
consoled
but
both
he
and
colden
after
the
severe
lesson
the
latter
had
received
were
now
all
for
vigilance
many
sentinels
had
been
posted
and
since
colden
was
glad
to
follow
the
advice
of
willet
and
tayoga
they
were
put
in
the
best
places
they
let
the
fire
die
early
as
the
weather
had
now
become
very
warm
and
all
of
them
save
the
watch
soon
slept
the
night
brought
little
coolness
with
it
and
the
wind
that
blew
was
warm
and
drying
under
its
touch
the
leaves
began
to
crinkle
up
at
the
edge
and
turn
brown
the
grass
showed
signs
of
withering
and
willet
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
guard
that
night
noticed
that
summer
was
passing
into
the
brown
leaf
it
caused
him
a
pang
of
disappointment
great
britain
and
the
colonies
had
not
yet
begun
to
move
the
provincial
legislatures
still
wrangled
and
the
government
at
london
was
provokingly
slow
there
was
still
no
plan
of
campaign
the
great
resources
of
the
anglosaxons
had
not
yet
been
brought
together
for
use
against
the
quick
and
daring
french
and
while
their
slow
patient
courage
might
win
in
the
end
willet
foresaw
a
long
and
terrible
war
with
many
disasters
at
the
beginning
he
was
depressed
for
the
moment
he
knew
what
an
impression
the
early
french
successes
would
make
on
the
indian
tribes
and
he
knew
too
as
he
heard
the
wind
rustling
through
the
dry
leaves
that
there
would
be
no
english
campaign
that
year
one
might
lead
an
army
in
winter
on
the
good
roads
and
through
the
open
fields
of
europe
but
then
only
borderers
could
make
way
through
the
vast
north
american
wilderness
in
the
deep
snows
and
bitter
cold
where
indian
trails
alone
existed
the
hunter
foresaw
a
long
delay
before
the
british
and
colonial
forces
moved
and
meanwhile
the
french
and
indians
would
be
more
strongly
planted
in
the
territory
claimed
by
the
rival
nations
and
while
in
law
possession
was
often
nine
points
it
seemed
in
war
to
be
ten
points
and
all
as
he
walked
back
and
forth
black
rifle
touched
him
on
the
arm
im
going
dave
he
said
they
dont
need
me
here
any
longer
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
likely
enough
will
follow
the
french
and
indians
and
have
another
brush
with
em
at
any
rate
its
sure
that
st
luc
and
tandakora
wont
come
back
and
these
young
men
can
go
on
without
being
attacked
again
and
build
their
fort
but
theyll
be
threatened
there
later
on
and
ill
come
again
with
a
warning
i
know
you
will
said
willet
wherever
danger
appears
on
the
border
black
rifle
there
you
are
i
see
great
and
terrible
days
ahead
for
us
all
and
so
do
i
said
black
rifle
this
continent
is
on
fire
the
two
shook
hands
and
the
somber
figure
of
black
rifle
disappeared
in
the
forest
willet
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
and
then
resumed
his
pacing
to
and
fro
they
made
an
early
start
at
dawn
of
a
bright
hot
day
crossed
the
ford
and
resumed
their
long
march
through
the
forest
which
under
the
light
wind
now
rustled
continually
with
the
increasing
dryness
but
the
company
was
joyous
the
wounded
were
put
upon
the
pack
horses
and
the
others
young
strong
and
refreshed
by
abundant
rest
went
forward
with
springing
steps
robert
and
tayoga
walked
with
the
three
philadelphians
colden
already
knew
the
quality
of
the
onondaga
and
respected
and
admired
him
and
wilton
and
carson
surprised
at
first
at
his
excellent
english
education
soon
saw
that
he
was
no
ordinary
youth
the
five
each
a
type
of
his
own
were
fast
friends
before
the
days
march
was
over
wilton
the
quaker
was
the
greatest
talker
of
them
all
which
he
declared
was
due
to
suppression
in
childhood
its
something
like
the
battle
fever
which
will
come
out
along
about
the
fourth
or
fifth
generation
he
said
i
suppose
theres
a
certain
amount
of
talk
that
every
man
must
do
in
his
lifetime
and
having
been
kept
in
a
state
of
silence
by
my
parents
all
through
my
youth
im
now
letting
myself
loose
in
the
woods
dont
apologize
will
said
colden
your
chatter
is
harmless
and
it
lightens
the
spirits
of
us
all
the
talker
has
his
uses
said
tayoga
gravely
my
friend
lennox
known
to
the
hodenosaunee
as
dagaeoga
is
goldenmouthed
the
gift
of
great
speech
descends
upon
him
when
time
and
place
are
fitting
and
so
youre
an
orator
are
you
said
carson
looking
at
robert
young
lennox
blushed
tayoga
is
my
very
good
friend
he
replied
and
he
gives
me
praise
i
dont
deserve
when
one
has
a
gift
direct
from
manitou
said
the
onondaga
gravely
it
is
not
well
to
deny
it
it
is
a
sign
of
great
favor
and
you
must
not
show
ingratitude
dagaeoga
he
has
you
lennox
laughed
wilton
but
you
neednt
say
more
i
know
that
tayoga
is
right
and
im
waiting
to
hear
you
talk
in
a
crisis
robert
blushed
once
more
but
was
silent
he
knew
that
if
he
protested
again
the
young
philadelphians
would
chaff
him
without
mercy
and
he
knew
at
heart
also
that
tayogas
statement
about
him
was
true
he
remembered
with
pride
his
defeat
of
st
luc
in
the
great
test
of
words
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
wiltons
mind
quickly
turned
to
another
subject
he
seemed
to
exemplify
the
truth
of
his
own
declaration
that
all
the
impulses
bottled
up
in
four
or
five
generations
of
quaker
ancestors
were
at
last
bursting
out
in
him
he
talked
more
than
all
the
others
combined
and
he
rejoiced
in
the
freedom
of
the
wilderness
im
a
spirit
released
he
said
thats
why
i
chatter
so
perhaps
its
just
as
well
will
that
while
you
have
the
chance
you
should
chatter
to
your
hearts
content
because
at
any
time
an
indian
arrow
may
cut
short
your
chance
for
chattering
said
carson
i
cant
believe
it
hugh
said
wilton
because
if
providence
was
willing
to
preserve
us
when
we
camped
squarely
among
the
indians
put
out
no
guards
and
fairly
asked
them
to
come
and
shoot
at
us
then
it
was
for
a
purpose
and
well
be
preserved
through
greater
and
continuous
dangers
there
may
be
something
in
it
will
i
notice
that
those
who
deserve
it
least
are
often
the
chosen
favorites
of
fortune
which
seems
to
be
a
hit
at
your
superior
officer
but
ill
pass
it
over
hugh
as
youre
always
right
at
heart
though
often
wrong
in
the
head
although
the
young
officers
talked
much
and
with
apparent
lightness
the
troop
marched
with
vigilance
now
willet
and
tayoga
and
colden
who
had
profited
by
bitter
experience
saw
to
it
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
often
assisted
by
robert
scouted
on
the
flanks
and
three
or
four
soldiers
who
developed
rapid
skill
in
the
woods
were
soon
able
to
help
but
tayoga
and
willet
were
the
main
reliance
and
they
found
no
further
trace
of
indians
nevertheless
the
guard
was
never
relaxed
for
an
instant
robert
found
the
march
not
only
pleasant
but
exhilarating
it
appealed
to
his
imaginative
and
sensitive
mind
which
magnified
everything
and
made
the
tints
more
vivid
and
brilliant
to
him
the
forests
were
larger
and
grander
than
they
were
to
the
others
and
the
rivers
were
wider
and
deeper
the
hours
were
more
intense
he
lived
every
second
of
them
and
the
future
had
a
scope
and
brilliancy
that
few
others
would
foresee
in
company
with
youths
of
his
own
age
coming
from
the
largest
city
of
the
british
colonies
the
one
that
had
the
richest
social
traditions
his
whole
nature
expanded
and
he
cast
away
much
of
his
reserve
around
the
campfires
in
the
evening
he
became
one
of
the
most
industrious
talkers
and
now
and
then
he
was
carried
away
so
much
by
his
own
impulse
that
all
the
rest
would
cease
and
listen
to
the
mellow
golden
voice
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
then
tayoga
and
willet
would
look
at
each
other
and
smile
knowing
that
dagaeoga
though
all
unconsciously
held
the
center
of
the
stage
and
the
others
were
more
than
willing
for
him
to
hold
it
the
friendships
of
the
young
ripen
fast
and
under
such
circumstances
they
ripen
faster
than
ever
robert
soon
felt
that
he
had
known
the
three
young
philadelphians
for
years
and
a
warm
friendship
destined
to
last
all
their
lives
in
which
tayoga
was
included
was
soon
formed
robert
saw
that
his
new
comrades
although
they
did
not
know
much
of
the
forest
were
intelligent
staunch
and
brave
and
they
saw
in
him
all
that
tayoga
and
willet
saw
which
was
a
great
deal
the
heat
and
dryness
increased
and
the
brown
of
leaf
and
grass
deepened
nearly
all
the
green
was
gone
now
and
autumn
would
soon
come
the
forest
was
full
of
game
and
willet
and
tayoga
kept
them
well
supplied
yet
their
progress
became
slower
those
who
had
been
wounded
severely
approached
the
critical
stage
and
once
they
stopped
two
days
until
all
danger
had
passed
three
days
later
a
fierce
summer
storm
burst
upon
them
tayoga
had
foreseen
it
and
the
whole
troop
was
gathered
in
the
lee
of
a
hill
with
all
their
ammunition
protected
by
blankets
canvas
and
the
skins
of
deer
that
they
had
killed
but
the
young
philadelphians
unaccustomed
to
the
fury
of
the
elements
in
the
wilderness
looked
upon
it
with
awe
in
the
west
the
lightning
blazed
and
the
thunder
crashed
for
a
long
time
often
the
forest
seemed
to
swim
in
a
red
glare
and
robert
himself
was
forced
to
shut
his
eyes
before
the
rapid
flashes
of
dazzling
brightness
then
came
a
great
rushing
of
wind
with
a
mighty
rain
on
its
edge
and
when
the
wind
died
the
rain
fell
straight
down
in
torrents
more
than
an
hour
although
they
kept
their
ammunition
and
other
supplies
dry
the
men
themselves
were
drenched
to
the
bone
but
the
storm
passed
more
suddenly
than
it
had
come
the
clouds
parted
on
the
horizon
then
all
fled
away
the
last
raindrop
fell
and
a
shining
sun
came
out
in
a
hot
blue
sky
as
the
men
resumed
a
drooping
march
their
clothes
dried
fast
in
the
fiery
rays
and
their
spirits
revived
when
night
came
they
were
dry
again
and
youth
had
taken
no
harm
the
next
day
they
struck
an
indian
trail
but
both
willet
and
tayoga
said
it
had
been
made
by
less
than
a
dozen
warriors
and
that
they
were
going
north
its
my
belief
said
willet
that
they
were
warriors
from
the
ohio
country
on
their
way
to
join
the
french
along
the
canadian
border
and
theyre
not
staying
to
meet
us
said
colden
im
afraid
will
itll
be
some
time
before
you
have
a
chance
to
show
your
unbottled
quaker
valor
perhaps
not
so
long
as
you
think
replied
wilton
who
had
plenty
of
penetration
i
dont
claim
to
be
any
great
forest
rover
although
i
do
think
ive
learned
something
since
i
left
philadelphia
but
i
imagine
that
our
building
of
a
fort
in
the
woods
will
draw
em
the
indian
runners
will
soon
be
carrying
the
news
of
it
and
then
theyll
cluster
around
us
like
flies
seeking
sugar
youre
right
mr
wilton
said
willet
after
we
build
this
fort
its
as
sure
as
the
sun
is
in
the
heavens
that
well
have
to
fight
for
it
two
days
later
they
reached
the
site
for
their
little
fortress
which
they
named
fort
refuge
because
they
intended
it
as
a
place
in
which
harried
settlers
might
find
shelter
it
was
a
hill
near
a
large
creek
and
the
source
of
a
small
brook
lay
within
the
grounds
they
intended
to
occupy
securing
to
them
an
unfailing
supply
of
good
water
in
case
of
siege
now
the
young
soldiers
entered
upon
one
of
the
most
arduous
tasks
of
the
war
to
build
a
fort
which
was
even
more
trying
to
them
than
battle
arms
and
backs
ached
as
colden
wilton
and
carson
advised
by
willet
drove
them
hard
a
strong
log
blockhouse
was
erected
and
then
a
stout
palisade
enclosing
the
house
and
about
an
acre
of
ground
including
the
precious
spring
which
spouted
from
under
a
ledge
of
stone
at
the
very
wall
of
the
blockhouse
itself
behind
the
building
they
raised
a
shed
in
which
the
horses
could
be
sheltered
as
all
of
them
foresaw
a
long
stay
dragging
into
winter
with
its
sleet
and
snow
and
it
was
important
to
save
the
animals
robert
willet
and
tayoga
had
a
roving
commission
and
as
they
could
stay
with
colden
and
his
command
as
long
as
they
chose
they
chose
accordingly
to
remain
where
they
thought
they
could
do
the
most
good
robert
took
little
part
in
the
hunting
but
labored
with
the
soldiers
on
the
building
although
it
was
not
the
kind
of
work
to
which
his
mind
turned
the
blockhouse
itself
was
divided
into
a
number
of
rooms
in
which
the
soldiers
who
were
not
on
guard
could
sleep
and
they
had
blankets
and
the
skins
of
the
larger
animals
the
hunters
killed
for
beds
venison
jerked
in
great
quantities
was
stored
away
in
case
of
siege
and
the
whole
forest
was
made
to
contribute
to
their
larder
the
work
was
hard
but
it
toughened
the
sinews
of
the
young
soldiers
and
gave
them
an
occupation
in
which
they
were
interested
before
it
was
finished
they
were
joined
by
another
small
detachment
with
loaded
pack
horses
which
by
the
same
kind
of
miracle
had
come
safely
through
the
wilderness
colden
now
had
a
hundred
men
fifty
horses
and
powder
and
lead
for
all
the
needs
of
which
one
could
think
if
we
only
had
a
cannon
he
said
looking
proudly
at
their
new
blockhouse
i
think
id
build
a
platform
for
it
there
on
the
roof
and
then
we
could
sweep
the
forest
in
every
direction
eh
will
my
lad
but
as
we
havent
said
wilton
well
have
to
do
the
sweeping
with
our
rifles
and
our
men
are
good
marksmen
as
they
showed
in
that
fight
with
st
luc
but
it
seems
a
world
away
from
philadelphia
doesnt
it
will
i
wonder
what
theyre
doing
there
counting
their
gains
in
the
west
india
trade
looking
at
the
latest
fashions
from
england
that
have
come
on
the
ships
up
the
delaware
building
new
houses
out
germantown
way
none
of
them
thinking
much
of
the
war
except
old
ben
franklin
who
pegs
forever
at
the
governor
of
the
province
the
legislature
and
every
influential
man
to
take
action
before
the
french
and
indians
seize
the
whole
border
i
hope
franklin
will
stir
em
up
and
that
they
wont
forget
us
out
here
in
the
woods
for
us
at
least
the
french
and
indians
are
a
reality
meanwhile
summer
had
turned
into
autumn
and
autumn
itself
was
passing
chapter
v
the
runner
fort
refuge
the
stronghold
raised
by
young
arms
was
the
most
distant
point
in
the
wilderness
held
by
the
angloamerican
forces
and
for
a
long
time
it
was
cut
off
entirely
from
the
world
no
message
came
out
of
the
great
forest
that
rimmed
it
round
but
colden
had
been
told
to
build
it
and
hold
it
until
he
had
orders
to
leave
it
and
he
and
his
men
waited
patiently
until
word
of
some
kind
should
come
or
they
should
be
attacked
by
the
french
and
indian
forces
that
were
gathering
continually
in
the
north
they
saw
the
autumn
reach
its
full
glory
the
wilderness
glowed
in
intense
yellows
and
reds
the
days
grew
cool
and
the
nights
cold
the
air
was
crisp
and
fresh
like
the
breath
of
life
the
young
men
felt
their
muscles
expand
and
their
courage
rise
and
they
longed
for
the
appearance
of
the
enemy
sure
that
behind
their
stout
palisade
they
would
be
able
to
defeat
whatever
numbers
came
tayoga
left
them
early
one
morning
for
a
visit
to
his
people
the
leaves
were
falling
then
under
a
sharp
west
wind
and
the
sky
had
a
cold
hard
tint
of
blue
steel
winter
was
not
far
away
but
the
day
suited
a
runner
like
tayoga
who
wished
to
make
speed
through
the
wilderness
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
strong
slender
figure
outlined
against
the
brown
waved
his
hand
to
his
friends
watching
on
the
palisade
and
then
disappeared
a
great
indian
said
young
wilton
thoughtfully
i
confess
that
i
never
knew
much
about
the
red
men
or
thought
much
about
them
until
i
met
him
i
dont
recall
having
come
into
contact
with
a
finer
mind
of
its
kind
most
of
the
white
people
make
the
mistake
of
undervaluing
the
indians
said
robert
but
well
learn
in
this
war
what
a
power
they
are
if
the
hodenosaunee
had
turned
against
us
wed
have
been
beaten
already
at
any
rate
tayoga
is
a
noble
type
since
i
had
to
come
into
the
forest
im
glad
to
meet
such
fellows
as
he
do
you
think
lennox
that
hell
get
through
safely
robert
laughed
get
through
safely
he
repeated
why
tayoga
is
the
fastest
runner
among
the
indian
nations
and
they
train
for
speed
he
goes
like
the
wind
he
never
tires
night
and
day
are
the
same
to
him
hes
so
light
of
foot
that
he
could
pass
through
a
band
of
his
own
comrades
and
they
would
never
know
he
was
there
and
yet
his
own
ears
are
so
keen
that
he
can
hear
the
leaves
falling
a
hundred
yards
away
the
path
from
here
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
may
be
lined
on
either
side
with
the
french
and
the
hostile
tribes
standing
as
thick
as
trees
in
the
forest
but
he
will
flit
between
them
as
safely
and
easily
as
you
and
i
would
ride
along
a
highroad
into
philadelphia
he
will
arrive
at
the
vale
of
onondaga
unharmed
at
the
exact
minute
he
intends
to
arrive
and
he
will
return
reaching
fort
refuge
also
on
the
exact
day
and
at
the
exact
hour
and
minute
he
has
already
selected
the
young
quaker
surveyed
robert
with
admiration
and
then
laughed
what
they
tell
of
you
is
true
he
said
in
truth
that
was
a
most
gorgeous
and
rounded
speech
you
made
about
your
friend
i
dont
recall
finer
and
more
flowing
periods
what
vividness
what
imagery
im
proud
to
know
you
lennox
robert
reddened
and
then
laughed
i
do
grow
enthusiastic
when
i
talk
about
tayoga
he
said
but
youll
see
that
what
i
predict
will
come
to
pass
hes
probably
told
willet
just
when
hell
be
back
at
fort
refuge
well
ask
him
the
hunter
informed
them
that
tayoga
intended
to
take
exactly
ten
days
this
is
monday
he
said
hell
be
here
a
week
from
next
thursday
at
noon
but
suppose
something
happens
to
detain
him
said
wilton
suppose
the
weather
is
too
bad
for
traveling
or
suppose
a
lot
of
other
things
that
can
happen
easily
willet
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
such
a
case
as
this
where
tayoga
is
concerned
he
said
we
dont
suppose
anything
we
go
by
certainties
before
he
left
tayoga
settled
the
day
and
the
hour
when
he
would
return
and
its
not
now
a
problem
or
a
question
he
has
disposed
of
the
subject
i
cant
quite
see
it
that
way
said
wilton
tenaciously
i
admit
that
tayoga
is
a
wonderful
fellow
but
he
cannot
possibly
tell
the
exact
hour
of
his
return
from
such
a
journey
as
the
one
he
has
undertaken
you
wait
and
see
said
the
hunter
in
the
utmost
good
nature
you
think
you
know
tayoga
but
you
dont
yet
know
him
fully
if
i
were
not
a
quaker
id
wager
a
small
sum
of
money
that
he
does
not
come
at
the
time
appointed
said
wilton
then
its
lucky
for
your
pocket
that
youre
a
quaker
laughed
willet
it
turned
much
colder
that
very
afternoon
and
the
raw
edge
of
winter
showed
the
wind
from
the
northwest
was
bitter
and
the
dead
leaves
fell
in
showers
at
dusk
a
chilling
rain
began
and
the
young
soldiers
shivering
were
glad
enough
to
seek
the
shelter
of
the
blockhouse
where
a
great
fire
was
blazing
on
the
broad
hearth
they
had
made
many
rude
camp
stools
and
sitting
down
on
one
before
the
blaze
wilton
let
the
pleasant
warmth
fall
upon
his
face
im
sorry
for
tayoga
he
said
to
robert
just
when
you
and
willet
were
boasting
most
about
him
this
winter
rain
had
to
come
and
he
was
no
more
than
fairly
started
hell
have
to
hunt
a
den
somewhere
in
the
forest
and
crouch
in
it
wrapped
in
his
blanket
robert
smiled
serenely
den
crouch
wrapped
in
his
blanket
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
his
mellow
golden
voice
are
you
speaking
of
my
friend
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
can
it
be
possible
wilton
that
you
are
referring
to
him
when
you
talk
of
such
humiliating
subterfuges
i
refer
to
him
and
none
other
lennox
i
see
him
now
stumbling
about
in
the
deep
forest
looking
for
shelter
no
wilton
you
dont
see
tayoga
you
merely
see
an
idle
figment
of
a
brain
that
does
not
yet
fully
know
my
friend
the
great
young
onondaga
but
i
see
him
and
i
see
him
clearly
i
behold
a
tall
strong
figure
head
slightly
bent
against
the
rain
eyes
that
see
in
the
dark
as
well
as
yours
see
in
the
brightest
sunlight
feet
that
move
surely
and
steadily
in
the
path
never
stumbling
and
never
veering
tireless
muscles
that
carry
him
on
without
slackening
dithyrambic
again
lennox
you
are
certainly
loyal
to
your
friend
as
for
me
im
glad
im
not
out
there
in
the
black
and
wet
forest
no
human
being
can
keep
to
his
pace
at
such
a
time
robert
again
smiled
serenely
but
he
said
nothing
more
his
confidence
was
unlimited
presently
he
wrapped
around
his
body
a
rude
but
serviceable
overcoat
of
beaver
skin
that
he
had
made
for
himself
and
went
out
the
cold
drizzling
icy
rain
that
creeps
into
ones
veins
was
still
falling
and
he
shivered
despite
his
furs
he
looked
toward
the
northeast
whither
tayogas
course
took
him
and
he
felt
sorry
for
his
red
comrade
but
he
never
doubted
that
he
was
speeding
on
his
way
with
sure
and
unfaltering
step
the
sentinels
mounted
on
the
broad
plank
that
ran
behind
the
palisade
were
walking
to
and
fro
wrapped
to
their
eyes
a
month
or
two
earlier
they
might
have
left
everything
on
such
a
night
to
take
care
of
itself
but
now
they
knew
far
better
captain
colden
with
the
terrible
lesson
of
the
battle
in
the
bush
had
become
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
willet
was
always
at
his
elbow
with
unobtrusive
but
valuable
advice
which
the
young
philadelphian
had
the
good
sense
to
welcome
robert
spoke
to
them
and
one
or
two
referred
to
the
indian
runner
who
had
gone
east
saying
that
he
might
have
had
a
better
night
for
his
start
the
repetition
of
wiltons
words
depressed
robert
for
a
moment
but
his
heart
came
back
with
a
bound
nothing
could
defeat
tayoga
did
he
not
know
his
red
comrade
the
wilderness
was
like
a
trimmed
garden
to
him
and
neither
rain
nor
hail
nor
snow
could
stop
him
as
he
said
the
word
hail
to
himself
it
came
pattering
upon
the
dead
leaves
and
the
palisade
in
a
whirlwind
of
white
pellets
again
he
shivered
and
knowing
it
was
no
use
to
linger
there
returned
inside
where
most
of
the
men
had
already
gone
to
sleep
he
stretched
himself
on
his
blanket
and
followed
them
in
slumber
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
it
was
still
hailing
and
wilton
said
in
a
serious
tone
that
he
hoped
tayoga
would
give
up
the
journey
and
come
back
to
fort
refuge
i
like
that
onondaga
he
said
and
i
dont
want
him
to
freeze
to
death
in
the
forest
why
the
earth
and
all
the
trees
are
coated
with
ice
now
and
even
if
a
man
lives
he
is
able
to
make
no
progress
once
more
robert
smiled
serenely
youre
thinking
of
the
men
you
knew
in
philadelphia
will
he
said
they
of
course
couldnt
make
such
a
flight
through
a
white
forest
but
tayoga
is
an
altogether
different
kind
of
fellow
hell
merely
exert
himself
a
little
more
and
go
on
as
fast
as
ever
wilton
looked
at
the
vast
expanse
of
glittering
ice
and
then
drew
the
folds
of
a
heavy
cloak
more
closely
about
his
body
i
rejoice
he
said
that
its
the
onondaga
and
not
myself
who
has
to
make
the
great
journey
i
rejoice
too
that
we
have
built
this
fort
its
not
philadelphia
that
fine
true
comfortable
city
but
its
shelter
against
the
hard
winter
that
i
see
coming
so
fast
colden
still
following
the
advice
of
willet
kept
his
men
busy
knowing
that
idleness
bred
discontent
and
destroyed
discipline
at
least
a
dozen
soldiers
taught
by
willet
and
robert
had
developed
into
excellent
hunters
and
as
the
game
was
abundant
owing
to
the
absence
of
indians
they
had
killed
deer
bear
panther
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
animals
that
ranged
these
forests
the
flesh
of
such
as
were
edible
was
cured
and
stored
as
they
foresaw
the
day
when
many
people
might
be
in
fort
refuge
and
the
food
would
be
needed
the
skins
also
were
dressed
and
were
put
upon
the
floor
or
hung
upon
the
walls
the
young
men
working
hard
were
happy
nevertheless
as
they
were
continually
learning
new
arts
and
the
life
was
healthy
to
an
extraordinary
degree
all
the
wounded
were
as
whole
as
before
and
everybody
acquired
new
and
stronger
muscles
their
content
would
have
been
yet
greater
in
degree
had
they
been
able
to
learn
what
was
going
on
outside
in
that
vast
world
where
france
and
britain
and
their
colonies
contended
so
fiercely
for
the
mastery
but
they
looked
at
the
wall
of
the
forest
and
it
was
a
blank
they
were
shut
away
from
all
things
as
completely
as
crusoe
on
his
island
nor
would
they
hear
a
single
whisper
until
tayoga
came
backif
he
came
back
on
the
second
day
after
the
onondagas
departure
the
air
softened
but
became
darker
the
glittering
white
of
the
forest
assumed
a
more
somber
tinge
clouds
marched
up
in
solemn
procession
from
the
southwest
and
mobilized
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
a
wind
touched
with
damp
blew
robert
knew
very
well
what
the
elements
portended
and
again
he
was
sorry
for
tayoga
but
as
before
after
the
first
few
moments
of
discouragement
his
courage
leaped
up
higher
than
ever
his
brilliant
imagination
at
once
painted
a
picture
in
which
every
detail
was
vivid
and
full
of
life
and
this
picture
was
of
a
vast
forest
trees
and
bushes
alike
clothed
in
ice
and
in
the
center
of
it
a
slender
figure
but
straight
tall
and
strong
tayoga
himself
speeding
on
like
the
arrow
from
the
bow
never
wavering
never
weary
then
his
mind
allowed
the
picture
to
fade
wilton
might
not
believe
tayoga
could
succeed
but
how
could
this
young
quaker
know
tayoga
as
he
knew
him
the
clouds
having
finished
their
mobilization
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
soon
spread
to
the
horizon
on
every
side
then
a
single
great
white
flake
dropped
slowly
and
gracefully
from
the
zenith
fell
within
the
palisade
and
melted
before
the
eyes
of
robert
and
wilton
but
it
was
merely
a
herald
of
its
fellows
which
descending
at
first
like
skirmishers
soon
thickened
into
companies
regiments
brigades
divisions
and
armies
then
all
the
air
was
filled
with
the
flakes
and
they
were
so
thick
they
could
not
see
the
forest
the
first
snow
of
the
winter
and
a
big
one
said
wilton
and
again
i
give
thanks
for
our
well
furnished
fort
there
may
be
greater
fortresses
in
europe
and
of
a
certainty
there
are
many
more
famous
but
there
is
none
finer
to
me
than
this
with
its
stout
log
walls
its
strong
broad
roofs
and
its
abundance
of
supplies
once
more
though
im
sorry
for
your
friend
tayoga
a
runner
may
go
fast
over
ice
if
hes
extremely
sure
of
foot
and
his
moccasins
are
good
but
i
know
of
no
way
in
which
he
can
speed
like
the
gull
in
its
flight
through
deep
snow
not
through
the
snow
but
he
may
be
on
it
said
robert
and
how
on
it
wise
but
cryptic
young
sir
snow
shoes
but
he
took
none
with
him
and
had
none
to
take
which
proves
nothing
the
indians
often
hide
in
the
forest
articles
theyll
need
at
some
far
day
a
canoe
may
be
concealed
in
a
thicket
at
the
creeks
edge
a
bow
and
arrows
may
be
thrust
away
under
a
ledge
all
awaiting
the
coming
of
their
owner
when
he
needs
them
most
the
chance
seems
too
small
to
me
lennox
i
cant
think
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
will
rise
out
of
the
forest
just
when
tayoga
wants
em
walk
up
to
him
and
say
please
strap
us
on
your
feet
i
make
concession
freely
that
the
onondaga
is
a
most
wonderful
fellow
but
he
cant
work
miracles
he
does
not
hold
such
complete
mastery
over
the
wilderness
that
it
will
obey
his
lightest
whisper
i
read
fairy
tales
in
my
youth
and
they
pleased
me
much
but
alas
they
were
fairy
tales
the
impossible
doesnt
happen
whos
the
great
talker
now
your
words
were
flowing
then
like
the
trickling
of
water
from
a
spout
but
youre
wrong
will
about
the
impossible
the
impossible
often
happens
great
spirits
like
tayoga
love
the
impossible
it
draws
them
on
it
arouses
their
energy
they
think
it
worth
while
ive
seen
tayoga
more
than
once
since
he
started
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
will
now
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
behold
him
once
more
hes
in
the
forest
the
snow
is
pouring
down
it
lies
a
foot
deep
on
the
ground
the
boughs
bend
with
it
and
sometimes
they
crack
under
it
with
a
report
like
that
of
a
rifle
the
tops
of
the
bushes
crowned
with
white
bend
their
weight
toward
the
ground
the
panthers
the
wolves
and
the
wildcats
all
lie
snug
in
their
dens
its
a
dead
world
save
for
one
figure
squarely
in
the
center
of
it
i
see
tayoga
bent
over
a
little
but
flying
straight
forward
at
a
speed
that
neither
you
nor
i
could
match
will
his
feet
do
not
sink
in
the
snow
he
skims
upon
it
like
a
swallow
through
the
air
his
feet
are
encased
in
something
long
and
narrow
he
has
on
snow
shoes
and
he
goes
like
the
wind
you
do
have
supreme
confidence
in
the
onondaga
lennox
so
would
you
if
you
knew
him
as
i
do
will
a
truth
ive
told
you
several
times
already
but
he
cant
provide
for
every
emergency
must
i
tell
you
for
the
twentieth
time
that
you
dont
know
tayoga
as
i
know
him
no
lennox
but
ill
wait
and
see
what
happens
the
fall
of
snow
lasted
the
entire
day
and
the
following
night
the
wilderness
was
singularly
beautiful
but
it
was
also
inaccessible
comfortable
for
those
in
the
fort
but
outside
the
snow
lay
nearly
two
feet
deep
i
hope
that
vision
of
yours
comes
true
said
wilton
to
robert
as
they
looked
at
the
forest
they
say
the
highland
scotch
can
go
into
trances
or
something
of
that
kind
and
look
into
the
future
and
i
believe
the
indians
claim
the
gift
but
ive
never
heard
that
english
and
americans
assumed
the
possession
of
such
powers
im
no
seer
laughed
robert
i
merely
use
my
imagination
and
produce
for
myself
a
picture
of
things
two
or
three
days
ahead
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
well
well
see
i
take
so
great
an
interest
in
the
journey
of
your
onondaga
friend
that
somehow
i
feel
myself
traveling
along
with
him
i
know
im
going
with
him
or
i
wouldnt
have
seen
him
flying
ahead
on
his
snow
shoes
but
come
will
ive
promised
to
teach
you
how
to
sew
buckskin
with
tendons
and
sinews
and
im
going
to
see
that
you
do
it
the
snow
despite
its
great
depth
was
premature
because
on
the
fourth
day
soft
winds
began
to
blow
and
all
the
following
night
a
warm
rain
fell
it
came
down
so
fast
that
the
whole
earth
was
flooded
and
the
air
was
all
fog
and
mist
the
creek
rose
far
beyond
its
banks
and
the
water
stood
in
pools
and
lakes
in
the
forest
now
in
very
truth
our
friend
tayoga
has
been
compelled
to
seek
a
lair
said
wilton
emphatically
his
snow
shoes
would
be
the
sorriest
of
drags
upon
his
feet
in
mud
and
water
and
without
them
he
will
sink
to
his
knees
the
wilderness
has
become
impassable
robert
laughed
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
for
him
said
wilton
but
i
do
then
what
in
heavens
name
is
it
i
not
only
see
the
way
for
tayoga
but
i
shut
my
eyes
once
more
and
i
see
him
using
it
he
has
put
away
his
snow
shoes
and
going
to
the
thick
bushes
at
the
edge
of
a
creek
he
has
taken
out
his
hidden
canoe
he
has
been
in
it
some
time
and
with
mighty
sweeps
of
the
paddle
that
he
knows
so
well
how
to
use
it
flies
like
a
wild
duck
over
the
water
now
he
passes
from
the
creek
into
a
river
flowing
eastward
and
swollen
by
the
floods
to
a
vast
width
the
rain
has
poured
upon
him
but
he
does
not
mind
it
the
powerful
exercise
with
the
paddles
dries
his
body
and
sends
the
pleasant
warmth
through
every
vein
his
feet
and
ankles
rest
after
his
long
flight
on
the
snow
shoes
and
his
heart
swells
with
pleasure
because
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
parts
of
his
journey
his
rifle
is
lying
by
his
side
and
he
could
seize
it
in
a
moment
should
an
enemy
appear
but
the
forest
on
either
side
of
the
stream
is
deserted
and
he
speeds
on
unhindered
there
may
be
better
canoemen
in
the
world
than
tayoga
but
i
doubt
it
come
come
lennox
you
go
too
far
i
can
admit
the
possibility
of
the
snow
shoes
and
their
appearance
at
the
very
moment
theyre
needed
but
the
evocation
of
a
river
and
a
canoe
at
the
opportune
instant
puts
too
high
a
strain
upon
credibility
then
dont
believe
it
unless
you
wish
to
do
so
laughed
robert
but
as
for
me
im
not
only
believing
it
but
im
almost
at
the
stage
of
knowing
it
the
flood
was
so
great
that
all
hunting
ceased
for
the
time
and
the
men
stayed
under
shelter
in
the
fort
while
the
fires
were
kept
burning
for
the
sake
of
both
warmth
and
cheer
but
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
great
ohio
valley
where
changes
in
temperature
are
often
rapid
and
violent
the
warm
rain
ceased
the
wind
came
out
of
the
southwest
cold
and
then
colder
the
logs
of
the
buildings
popped
with
the
contracting
cold
all
through
the
following
night
and
the
next
dawn
came
bright
clear
and
still
but
far
below
zero
the
ice
was
thick
on
the
creek
and
every
new
pool
and
lake
was
covered
the
trees
and
bushes
that
had
been
dripping
the
day
before
were
sheathed
in
silver
mail
breath
curled
away
like
smoke
from
the
lips
if
tayoga
stayed
in
his
canoe
said
wilton
hes
frozen
solidly
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
he
wont
be
able
to
move
it
until
a
thaw
comes
robert
laughed
with
genuine
amusement
and
also
with
a
certain
scorn
ive
told
you
many
times
will
he
said
that
you
didnt
know
all
about
tayoga
but
now
it
seems
that
you
know
nothing
about
him
well
then
wherein
am
i
wrong
sir
robert
the
omniscient
asked
wilton
in
your
assumption
that
tayoga
would
not
foresee
what
was
coming
having
spent
nearly
all
his
life
with
nature
he
has
naturally
been
forced
to
observe
all
of
its
manifestations
even
the
most
delicate
and
when
you
add
to
these
necessities
the
powers
of
an
exceedingly
strong
and
penetrating
mind
you
have
developed
faculties
that
can
cope
with
almost
anything
tayoga
foresaw
this
big
freeze
and
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
he
did
as
accurately
as
if
i
had
been
there
and
had
seen
it
he
kept
to
the
river
and
his
canoe
almost
until
the
first
thin
skim
of
ice
began
to
show
then
he
paddled
to
land
and
hid
the
canoe
again
among
thick
bushes
he
raised
it
up
a
little
on
low
boughs
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
not
touch
the
water
thus
it
was
safe
from
the
ice
and
so
leaving
it
well
hidden
and
in
proper
condition
and
situation
he
sped
on
of
course
youre
a
master
with
words
robert
and
the
longer
they
are
the
better
you
seem
to
like
em
but
how
is
the
onondaga
to
make
speed
over
the
ice
which
now
covers
the
earth
snow
shoes
i
take
it
would
not
be
available
upon
such
a
smooth
and
tricky
surface
and
at
any
rate
he
has
left
them
far
behind
in
part
of
your
assumption
youre
right
will
tayoga
hasnt
the
snow
shoes
now
and
he
wouldnt
use
em
if
he
had
em
he
foresaw
the
possibility
of
the
freeze
and
took
with
him
in
his
pack
a
pair
of
heavy
moose
skin
moccasins
with
the
hair
on
the
outside
theyre
so
rough
they
do
not
slip
on
the
ice
especially
when
they
inclose
the
feet
of
a
runner
so
wiry
so
agile
and
so
experienced
as
tayoga
once
more
i
close
my
eyes
and
i
see
his
brown
figure
shooting
through
the
white
forest
he
goes
even
faster
than
he
did
when
he
had
on
the
snow
shoes
because
whenever
he
comes
to
a
slope
he
throws
himself
back
upon
his
heels
and
lets
himself
slide
down
the
ice
almost
at
the
speed
of
a
bird
darting
through
the
air
if
youre
right
lennox
your
red
friend
is
not
merely
a
marvel
but
a
series
of
marvels
im
right
will
i
do
not
doubt
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
tenth
day
when
tayoga
arrives
on
the
return
from
the
vale
of
onondaga
you
will
gladly
admit
the
truth
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
my
gladness
lennox
if
it
should
come
true
but
the
elements
seem
to
have
conspired
against
him
and
ive
learned
that
in
the
wilderness
the
elements
count
very
heavily
earth
fire
and
water
may
all
join
against
him
but
at
the
time
appointed
he
will
come
i
know
it
the
great
cold
and
it
was
hard
fierce
and
bitter
lasted
two
days
at
night
the
popping
of
the
contracting
timbers
sounded
like
a
continuous
pistol
fire
but
willet
had
foreseen
everything
at
his
instance
colden
had
made
the
young
soldiers
gather
vast
quantities
of
fuel
long
ago
from
a
forest
which
was
filled
everywhere
with
dead
boughs
and
fallen
timber
the
accumulation
of
scores
of
years
then
another
great
thaw
came
and
the
fickle
climate
proceeded
to
show
what
it
could
do
when
the
thaw
had
been
going
on
for
a
day
and
a
night
a
terrific
winter
hurricane
broke
over
the
forest
trees
were
shattered
as
if
their
trunks
had
been
shot
through
by
huge
cannon
balls
here
and
there
long
windrows
were
piled
up
and
vast
areas
were
a
litter
of
broken
boughs
as
i
reckon
and
allowing
for
the
marvels
you
say
he
can
perform
tayoga
is
now
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
lennox
said
wilton
its
lucky
that
hes
there
in
the
comfortable
log
houses
of
his
own
people
because
a
man
could
scarcely
live
in
the
forest
in
such
a
storm
as
this
as
he
would
be
beaten
to
death
by
flying
timbers
this
time
will
youre
wrong
in
both
assumptions
tayoga
has
already
been
to
the
vale
of
onondaga
he
has
spent
there
the
half
day
that
he
allowed
to
himself
and
now
on
the
return
journey
has
left
the
vale
far
behind
him
i
told
you
how
sensitive
he
was
to
the
changes
of
the
weather
and
he
knew
it
was
coming
several
hours
before
it
arrived
he
sought
at
once
protection
probably
a
cleft
in
the
rock
or
an
opening
of
two
or
three
feet
under
a
stony
ledge
he
is
lying
there
now
just
as
snug
and
safe
as
you
please
while
this
storm
which
covers
a
vast
area
rages
over
his
head
there
is
much
that
is
primeval
in
tayoga
and
his
comfort
and
safety
make
him
fairly
enjoy
the
storm
as
he
lies
under
the
ledge
with
his
blanket
drawn
around
him
he
is
warm
and
dry
and
his
sense
of
comfort
contrasting
his
pleasant
little
den
with
the
fierce
storm
without
becomes
one
of
luxury
i
suppose
of
course
lennox
that
you
can
shut
your
eyes
and
see
him
once
more
without
any
trouble
in
all
truth
and
certainty
i
can
will
he
is
lying
on
a
stone
shelf
with
a
stone
ledge
above
him
his
blanket
takes
away
the
hardness
of
the
stone
that
supports
him
he
sees
boughs
and
sticks
whirled
past
by
the
storm
but
none
of
them
touches
him
he
hears
the
wind
whistling
and
screaming
at
a
pitch
so
fierce
that
it
would
terrify
one
unused
to
the
forest
but
it
is
only
a
song
in
the
ears
of
tayoga
it
soothes
him
it
lulls
him
and
knowing
that
he
cant
use
the
period
of
the
storm
for
traveling
he
uses
it
for
sleep
thus
enabling
him
to
take
less
later
on
when
the
storm
has
ceased
so
after
all
he
loses
nothing
so
far
as
his
journey
is
concerned
now
his
lids
droop
his
eyes
close
and
he
slumbers
while
the
storm
thunders
past
unable
to
touch
him
you
do
have
the
gift
lennox
i
believe
that
sometimes
your
words
are
music
in
your
own
ears
and
inspire
you
to
greater
efforts
when
the
war
is
over
you
must
surely
become
a
public
manone
who
is
often
called
upon
to
address
the
people
well
fight
the
war
first
laughed
robert
the
storm
in
its
rise
its
zenith
and
its
decline
lasted
several
hours
and
when
it
was
over
the
forest
looked
like
a
wreck
but
robert
knew
that
nature
would
soon
restore
everything
the
foliage
of
next
spring
would
cover
up
the
ruin
and
new
growth
would
take
the
place
of
the
old
and
broken
the
wilderness
forever
restoring
what
was
lost
always
took
care
of
itself
a
day
or
two
of
fine
clear
winter
weather
not
too
cold
followed
and
willet
went
forth
to
scout
he
was
gone
until
the
next
morning
and
when
he
returned
his
face
was
very
grave
there
are
indians
in
the
forest
he
said
not
friendly
warriors
of
the
hodenosaunee
but
those
allied
with
the
enemy
i
think
a
formidable
ojibway
band
under
tandakora
is
there
and
also
other
indians
from
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
they
may
have
started
against
us
some
time
back
but
were
probably
halted
by
the
bad
weather
theyre
in
different
bodies
now
scattered
perhaps
for
hunting
but
theyll
reunite
before
long
did
you
see
signs
of
any
white
men
dave
asked
robert
yes
french
officers
and
some
soldiers
are
with
em
but
i
dont
think
st
luc
is
in
the
number
more
likely
its
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
whom
we
have
such
good
cause
to
remember
i
hope
so
dave
id
rather
fight
against
those
two
than
against
st
luc
so
would
i
and
for
several
reasons
st
luc
is
a
better
leader
than
they
are
theyre
able
but
hes
the
best
of
all
the
french
that
afternoon
two
men
who
ventured
a
short
distance
from
fort
refuge
were
shot
at
and
one
was
wounded
slightly
but
both
were
able
to
regain
the
little
fortress
willet
slipped
out
again
and
reported
the
forest
swarming
with
indians
although
there
was
yet
no
indication
of
a
preconcerted
attack
still
it
was
well
for
the
garrison
to
keep
close
and
take
every
precaution
and
this
shuts
out
tayoga
said
wilton
regretfully
to
robert
he
may
make
his
way
through
rain
and
flood
and
sleet
and
snow
and
hurricane
but
he
can
never
pass
those
watchful
hordes
of
indians
in
the
woods
once
more
the
onondagas
loyal
friend
laughed
the
warriors
turn
tayoga
back
will
he
said
he
will
pass
through
em
just
as
if
they
were
not
there
the
time
will
be
up
day
after
tomorrow
at
noon
and
then
he
will
be
here
even
if
the
indians
move
up
and
besiege
us
in
regular
form
even
that
and
even
anything
else
at
noon
day
after
tomorrow
tayoga
will
be
here
another
man
who
went
out
to
bring
in
a
horse
that
had
been
left
grazing
near
the
fort
was
fired
upon
not
with
rifles
or
muskets
but
with
arrows
and
grazed
in
the
shoulder
he
had
however
the
presence
of
mind
to
spring
upon
the
animals
back
and
gallop
for
fort
refuge
where
the
watchful
willet
threw
open
the
gate
to
the
stockade
let
him
in
then
quickly
closed
and
barred
it
fast
a
long
fierce
whining
cry
the
war
whoop
came
from
the
forest
the
siege
has
closed
in
already
said
robert
and
its
well
that
we
have
no
other
men
outside
except
tayoga
said
wilton
the
barrier
of
the
red
army
doesnt
count
so
far
as
tayoga
is
concerned
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
will
that
tayoga
will
come
at
the
time
appointed
after
the
shout
from
the
woods
there
was
a
long
silence
that
weighed
upon
the
young
soldiers
isolated
thus
in
the
wintry
and
desolate
wilderness
they
were
city
men
used
to
the
streets
and
the
sounds
of
people
and
their
situation
had
many
aspects
that
were
weird
and
appalling
they
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
civilization
and
around
them
everywhere
stretched
a
black
forest
hiding
a
tenacious
and
cruel
foe
but
on
the
other
hand
their
stockade
was
stout
they
had
plenty
of
ammunition
water
and
provisions
and
one
victory
already
to
their
credit
after
the
first
moments
of
depression
they
recalled
their
courage
and
eagerly
awaited
an
attack
but
the
attack
did
not
come
and
robert
knew
it
would
not
be
made
at
least
not
yet
the
indians
were
too
wary
to
batter
themselves
to
pieces
against
the
palisade
and
the
frenchmen
with
them
skilled
in
forest
war
would
hold
them
back
perhaps
theyve
gone
away
realizing
that
were
too
strong
for
em
said
wilton
thats
just
what
we
must
guard
against
said
robert
the
indian
fights
with
trick
and
stratagem
he
always
has
more
time
than
the
white
man
and
he
is
wholly
willing
to
wait
they
want
us
to
think
theyve
left
and
then
theyll
cut
off
the
incautious
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
the
silence
which
had
grown
oppressive
persisted
a
light
pleasant
wind
blew
through
the
forest
which
was
now
dry
and
the
dead
bark
and
wintry
branches
rustled
to
many
of
the
youths
it
became
a
forest
of
gloom
and
threat
and
they
asked
impatiently
why
the
warriors
did
not
come
out
and
show
themselves
like
men
certainly
it
did
not
become
frenchmen
if
they
were
there
to
lurk
in
the
woods
and
seek
ambush
willet
was
the
pervading
spirit
of
the
defense
deft
in
word
and
action
acknowledging
at
all
times
that
colden
was
the
commander
thus
saving
the
young
philadelphians
pride
in
the
presence
of
his
men
he
contrived
in
an
unobtrusive
way
to
direct
everything
the
guards
were
placed
at
suitable
intervals
about
the
palisade
and
were
instructed
to
fire
at
anything
suspicious
the
others
were
compelled
to
stay
in
the
blockhouse
and
take
their
ease
in
order
that
their
nerves
might
be
steady
and
true
when
the
time
for
battle
came
the
cooks
were
also
instructed
to
prepare
an
unusually
bountiful
supper
for
them
robert
was
willets
right
hand
next
to
the
hunter
he
knew
most
about
the
wilderness
and
the
ways
of
its
red
people
there
was
no
possibility
that
the
indians
had
gone
even
if
they
did
not
undertake
to
storm
the
fort
they
would
linger
near
it
in
the
hope
of
cutting
off
men
who
came
forth
incautiously
and
at
night
especially
if
it
happened
to
be
dark
they
would
be
sure
to
come
very
close
the
palisade
was
about
eight
feet
high
and
the
men
stood
on
a
horizontal
plank
three
feet
from
the
ground
leaving
only
the
head
to
project
above
the
shelter
and
willet
warned
them
to
be
exceedingly
careful
when
the
twilight
came
since
the
besiegers
would
undoubtedly
use
the
darkness
as
a
cover
for
sharpshooting
then
both
he
and
robert
looked
anxiously
at
the
sun
which
was
just
setting
behind
the
black
waste
the
night
will
be
dark
said
the
hunter
and
thats
bad
im
afraid
some
of
our
sentinels
will
be
picked
off
robert
you
and
i
must
not
sleep
until
tomorrow
we
must
stay
on
watch
here
all
the
while
as
he
predicted
the
night
came
down
black
and
grim
vast
banks
of
darkness
rolled
up
close
to
the
palisade
and
the
forest
showed
but
dimly
then
the
warriors
proved
to
the
most
incredulous
that
they
had
not
gone
far
away
scattered
shots
were
fired
from
the
woods
and
one
sentinel
who
in
spite
of
warnings
thrust
his
head
too
high
above
the
palisade
received
a
bullet
through
it
falling
back
dead
it
was
a
terrible
lesson
but
afterwards
the
others
took
no
risks
although
they
were
anxious
to
fire
on
hostile
figures
that
their
fancy
saw
for
them
among
the
trees
willet
robert
and
colden
compelled
them
to
withhold
their
fire
until
a
real
and
tangible
enemy
appeared
later
in
the
night
burning
arrows
were
discharged
in
showers
and
fell
within
the
palisade
some
on
the
buildings
but
they
had
pails
and
an
unfailing
spring
and
they
easily
put
out
the
flames
although
one
man
was
struck
and
suffered
both
a
burn
and
a
bruise
toward
midnight
a
terrific
succession
of
war
whoops
came
and
a
great
number
of
warriors
charged
in
the
darkness
against
the
palisade
the
garrison
was
ready
and
despite
the
darkness
poured
forth
such
a
fierce
fire
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
horde
vanished
leaving
behind
several
still
forms
which
they
stole
away
later
another
of
the
young
philadelphians
was
killed
and
before
dawn
he
and
his
comrade
who
had
been
slain
earlier
in
the
evening
were
buried
behind
the
blockhouse
at
intervals
in
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
warriors
fired
either
arrows
or
bullets
doing
no
farther
damage
except
the
slight
wounding
of
one
man
and
when
day
came
willet
and
robert
worn
to
the
bone
sought
a
little
rest
and
sleep
in
the
blockhouse
they
knew
that
golden
could
not
be
surprised
while
the
sun
was
shining
and
that
the
savages
were
not
likely
to
attempt
anything
serious
until
the
following
night
so
they
felt
they
were
not
needed
for
the
present
robert
slept
until
nearly
noon
when
he
ate
heartily
of
the
abundant
food
one
of
the
young
cooks
had
prepared
and
learned
that
beyond
an
occasional
arrow
or
bullet
the
forest
had
given
forth
no
threat
his
own
spirits
rose
high
with
the
day
which
was
uncommonly
brilliant
with
a
great
sun
shining
in
the
center
of
the
heavens
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
wilton
was
near
the
blockhouse
and
was
confident
about
the
siege
but
worried
about
tayoga
you
tell
me
that
the
indians
wont
go
away
he
said
and
if
youre
right
and
i
think
you
are
the
onondaga
is
surely
shut
off
from
fort
refuge
robert
smiled
i
tell
you
for
the
last
time
that
he
will
come
at
the
appointed
hour
he
said
a
long
day
began
hours
that
seemed
days
in
themselves
passed
and
quiet
prevailed
in
the
forest
although
the
young
soldiers
no
longer
had
any
belief
that
the
warriors
had
gone
away
chapter
vi
the
return
it
was
near
the
close
of
a
day
that
had
been
marked
by
little
demonstration
from
the
enemy
and
the
young
officers
growing
used
to
the
siege
attained
a
philosophical
state
of
mind
they
felt
sure
they
could
hold
the
palisade
against
any
number
of
enemies
and
the
foresight
of
willet
robert
and
tayoga
had
been
so
great
that
by
no
possibility
could
they
be
starved
out
they
began
now
to
have
a
certain
exultation
they
were
inside
comfortable
walls
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
while
the
enemy
was
outside
and
must
forage
for
game
if
it
were
not
for
tayoga
said
wilton
to
robert
i
should
feel
more
than
satisfied
with
the
situation
but
the
fate
of
your
onondaga
friend
sticks
in
my
mind
mr
willet
who
knows
everything
says
were
surrounded
completely
and
i
dont
wish
him
to
lose
his
life
in
an
attempt
to
get
through
at
a
certain
time
merely
on
a
point
of
honor
its
no
point
of
honor
will
its
just
the
completion
of
a
plan
at
the
time
and
place
chosen
do
you
see
anything
in
that
tall
tree
to
the
east
of
the
palisade
something
appears
to
be
moving
up
the
trunk
but
as
its
on
the
far
side
i
catch
only
a
glimpse
of
it
thats
an
indian
warrior
seeking
a
place
for
a
shot
at
us
hell
reach
the
high
fork
but
hell
always
keep
well
behind
the
body
of
the
tree
its
really
too
far
for
a
bullet
but
i
think
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
slip
back
under
cover
the
sharpshooter
reached
his
desired
station
and
fired
but
his
bullet
fell
short
he
tried
three
more
all
without
avail
and
then
willet
picked
him
off
with
his
long
and
deadly
rifle
robert
shut
his
eyes
when
he
saw
the
body
begin
its
fall
but
his
vivid
imagination
so
easily
excited
made
him
hear
its
thump
when
it
struck
the
earth
and
so
ends
that
attempt
he
said
an
hour
later
he
saw
a
white
flag
among
the
trees
and
when
willet
mounted
the
palisade
two
french
officers
came
forward
robert
saw
at
once
that
they
were
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
and
his
heart
beat
hard
they
linked
him
with
quebec
in
which
he
had
spent
some
momentous
days
and
despite
their
treachery
to
him
he
did
not
feel
hatred
of
them
at
that
moment
will
you
stay
with
me
mr
willet
and
you
also
mr
lennox
while
i
talk
to
them
asked
captain
colden
you
know
these
frenchmen
better
than
i
do
and
their
experience
is
so
much
greater
than
mine
that
i
need
your
help
robert
and
the
hunter
assented
gladly
robert
in
truth
was
very
curious
to
hear
what
these
old
friends
and
enemies
of
his
had
to
say
and
he
felt
a
thrill
when
the
two
recognized
and
saluted
him
in
the
most
friendly
fashion
just
as
if
they
had
never
meant
him
any
harm
chance
brings
about
strange
meetings
between
us
mr
lennox
said
de
courcelles
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
note
that
you
have
not
yet
taken
any
personal
harm
from
our
siege
nor
you
nor
monsieur
de
jumonville
from
our
successful
defense
replied
robert
in
the
same
spirit
you
have
us
there
the
points
so
far
are
in
your
favor
although
only
superficially
so
as
i
shall
make
clear
to
you
presently
then
de
courcelles
turned
his
attention
to
colden
who
he
saw
was
the
nominal
leader
of
the
garrison
my
name
he
said
is
auguste
de
courcelles
a
colonel
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
king
louis
of
france
my
friend
is
captain
francois
de
jumonville
and
we
have
the
honor
to
lead
the
numerous
and
powerful
force
of
french
and
indians
now
besieging
you
and
my
name
is
colden
captain
james
colden
replied
the
young
officer
ive
heard
of
you
from
my
friends
mr
lennox
and
mr
willet
and
i
have
the
honor
of
asking
you
what
i
can
do
for
you
you
cannot
do
for
us
more
than
you
can
do
for
yourself
captain
colden
we
ask
the
surrender
of
your
little
fort
and
of
your
little
garrison
which
we
freely
admit
has
defended
itself
most
gallantly
its
not
necessary
for
us
to
make
an
assault
youre
deep
in
the
wilderness
we
can
hold
you
here
all
winter
and
help
cannot
possibly
come
to
you
we
guarantee
you
good
treatment
in
canada
where
you
will
be
held
until
the
war
is
over
young
colden
smiled
they
were
standing
before
the
single
gate
in
the
palisade
and
he
looked
back
at
the
solid
buildings
erected
by
the
hands
of
his
own
men
with
the
comfortable
smoke
curling
up
against
the
cold
sky
and
he
looked
also
at
the
wintry
forest
that
curved
in
every
direction
colonel
de
courcelles
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
in
and
you
are
out
if
it
comes
to
holding
us
here
all
winter
we
who
have
good
houses
can
stand
it
much
better
than
you
who
merely
have
the
forest
as
a
home
where
you
will
be
rained
upon
snowed
upon
hailed
upon
and
maybe
frozen
why
should
we
exchange
our
warm
house
for
your
cold
forest
colonel
de
courcelles
frowned
there
was
a
humorous
inflection
in
coldens
tone
that
did
not
please
him
and
the
young
officers
words
also
had
a
strong
element
of
truth
its
not
a
time
to
talk
about
houses
and
forests
he
said
somewhat
haughtily
we
have
here
a
formidable
force
capable
of
carrying
your
fort
and
for
that
reason
we
demand
your
surrender
indians
are
always
inflamed
by
a
long
and
desperate
resistance
and
while
captain
de
jumonville
and
i
will
do
our
best
to
restrain
them
its
possible
that
they
may
escape
from
our
control
in
the
hour
of
victory
young
colden
smiled
again
with
willet
at
his
right
hand
and
robert
at
his
left
he
acquired
lightness
of
spirit
a
demand
and
a
threat
together
he
replied
for
the
threat
we
dont
care
we
dont
believe
youll
ever
see
that
hour
of
victory
in
which
you
cant
control
your
indians
and
therell
be
no
need
for
you
colonel
de
courcelles
to
apologize
for
a
massacre
committed
by
your
allies
and
which
you
couldnt
help
were
also
growing
used
to
requests
of
surrender
there
was
your
countryman
st
luc
a
very
brave
and
skillful
man
who
asked
it
of
us
but
we
declined
and
in
the
end
we
defeated
him
and
if
we
beat
st
luc
without
the
aid
of
a
strong
fort
why
shouldnt
we
beat
you
with
it
colonel
de
courcelles
colonel
de
courcelles
frowned
once
more
and
captain
de
jumonville
frowned
with
him
you
dont
know
the
wilderness
captain
colden
he
said
and
you
dont
give
our
demand
the
serious
consideration
to
which
it
is
entitled
later
on
the
truth
of
what
i
tell
you
may
bear
heavily
upon
you
i
may
not
know
the
forest
as
you
do
colonel
de
courcelles
but
i
have
with
me
masters
of
woodcraft
mr
lennox
and
mr
willet
with
whom
youre
already
acquainted
weve
had
passages
of
various
kinds
with
colonel
de
courcelles
both
in
the
forest
and
at
quebec
said
robert
quietly
both
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
flushed
and
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
anxious
to
end
the
interview
this
i
take
it
is
your
final
answer
the
french
colonel
said
to
the
young
philadelphia
captain
it
is
sir
then
what
may
occur
rests
upon
the
knees
of
the
gods
it
does
sir
and
im
as
willing
as
you
to
abide
by
the
result
and
i
have
the
honor
of
bidding
you
good
day
an
equally
great
honor
is
mine
the
two
french
officers
were
ceremonious
they
lifted
their
fine
threecornered
hats
and
bowed
politely
and
colden
willet
and
robert
were
not
inferior
in
courtesy
then
the
frenchmen
walked
away
into
the
forest
while
the
three
americans
went
inside
the
palisade
where
the
heavy
gate
was
quickly
shut
behind
them
and
fastened
securely
but
before
he
turned
back
robert
thought
he
saw
the
huge
figure
of
tandakora
in
the
forest
when
the
french
officers
disappeared
several
shots
were
fired
and
the
savages
uttered
a
long
and
menacing
war
whoop
but
the
young
soldiers
had
grown
used
to
such
manifestations
and
instead
of
being
frightened
they
felt
a
certain
defiant
pleasure
yells
dont
hurt
us
said
wilton
to
robert
instead
i
feel
my
quaker
blood
rising
in
anger
and
id
rejoice
if
they
were
to
attack
now
a
very
heavy
responsibility
rests
upon
me
robert
since
ive
to
fight
not
only
for
myself
but
for
my
ancestors
who
wouldnt
fight
at
all
it
rests
upon
me
one
humble
youth
to
bring
up
the
warlike
average
of
the
family
youre
one
will
but
youre
not
humble
laughed
robert
i
believe
that
jest
of
yours
about
the
still
blood
of
generations
bursting
forth
in
you
at
last
is
not
a
jest
wholly
when
it
comes
to
a
pitched
battle
i
expect
to
see
you
perform
prodigies
of
valor
if
i
do
it
wont
be
will
wilton
myself
and
i
wont
be
entitled
to
any
credit
ill
be
merely
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
fate
working
out
the
law
of
averages
but
what
do
you
think
those
french
officers
and
their
savage
allies
will
do
now
robert
since
colden
so
to
speak
has
thrown
a
very
hard
glove
in
their
faces
draw
the
lines
tighter
about
fort
refuge
its
cold
in
the
forest
but
they
can
live
there
for
a
while
at
least
theyll
build
fires
and
throw
up
a
few
tepees
maybe
for
the
french
but
their
anger
and
their
desire
to
take
us
will
make
them
watch
all
the
more
closely
theyll
draw
tight
lines
around
this
snug
little
strong
little
fort
of
ours
which
removes
all
possibility
that
your
friend
tayoga
will
come
at
the
appointed
time
robert
glared
at
him
will
he
said
ive
discovered
that
you
have
a
double
nature
although
the
two
are
never
struggling
for
you
at
the
same
time
that
is
i
march
tandem
with
my
two
natures
so
to
speak
they
alternate
at
times
youre
a
sensible
boy
boy
im
older
than
you
are
one
wouldnt
think
it
but
a
well
bred
quaker
never
interrupts
as
i
said
youre
quite
sensible
at
times
and
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
saying
so
at
other
times
your
mind
loves
folly
it
fairly
swims
and
dives
in
the
foolish
pool
and
it
dives
deepest
when
youre
talking
about
tayoga
i
trust
foolish
young
sir
that
ive
heard
the
last
word
of
folly
from
you
about
the
arrival
of
tayoga
or
rather
what
you
conceive
will
be
his
failure
to
arrive
peace
not
a
word
at
least
let
me
say
this
protested
wilton
i
wish
that
i
could
feel
the
absolute
confidence
in
any
human
being
that
you
so
obviously
have
in
the
onondaga
the
night
came
white
and
beautiful
it
was
white
because
the
milky
way
was
at
its
brightest
which
was
uncommonly
bright
and
every
star
that
ever
showed
itself
in
that
latitude
came
out
and
danced
the
heavens
were
full
of
them
disporting
themselves
in
clusters
on
spangled
seas
and
the
forest
was
all
in
light
paler
than
that
of
day
but
almost
as
vivid
the
indians
lighted
several
fires
well
beyond
rifle
shot
and
the
sentinels
on
the
palisade
distinctly
saw
their
figures
passing
back
and
forth
before
the
blaze
robert
also
noticed
the
uniforms
of
frenchmen
and
he
thought
it
likely
that
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
had
with
them
more
soldiers
than
he
had
supposed
at
first
the
fires
burned
at
different
points
of
the
compass
and
thus
the
fort
was
encircled
completely
by
them
both
young
lennox
and
willet
knew
they
had
been
lighted
that
way
purposely
that
is
in
order
to
show
to
the
defenders
that
a
belt
of
fire
and
steel
was
drawn
close
about
them
to
wilton
at
least
the
indian
circle
seemed
impassable
and
despite
the
enormous
confidence
of
robert
he
now
had
none
at
all
himself
it
was
impossible
for
tayoga
even
if
he
had
triumphed
over
sleet
and
snow
and
flood
and
storm
to
pass
so
close
a
siege
he
would
not
speak
of
it
again
but
robert
had
allowed
himself
to
be
deluded
by
friendship
he
felt
sorry
for
his
new
friend
and
he
did
not
wish
to
see
his
disappointment
on
the
morrow
wilton
was
in
charge
of
the
guard
until
midnight
and
then
he
slept
soundly
until
dawn
awakening
to
a
brilliant
day
the
fit
successor
of
such
a
brilliant
night
the
indian
fires
were
still
burning
and
he
could
see
the
warriors
beside
them
sleeping
or
eating
at
leisure
they
still
formed
a
complete
circle
about
the
fort
and
while
the
young
quaker
felt
safe
inside
the
palisade
he
saw
no
chance
for
a
friend
outside
robert
joined
him
presently
but
respecting
his
feelings
the
philadelphian
said
nothing
about
tayoga
the
winter
it
seemed
was
exerting
itself
to
show
how
fine
a
day
it
could
produce
it
was
cold
but
dazzling
a
gorgeous
sun
all
red
and
gold
was
rising
and
the
light
was
so
vivid
and
intense
that
they
could
see
far
in
the
forest
bare
of
leaf
robert
clearly
discerned
both
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
about
six
hundred
yards
away
standing
by
one
of
the
fires
then
he
saw
the
gigantic
figure
of
tandakora
as
the
ojibway
joined
them
despite
the
cold
tandakora
wore
little
but
the
breechcloth
and
his
mighty
chest
and
shoulders
were
painted
with
many
hideous
devices
in
the
distance
and
in
the
glow
of
the
flames
his
size
was
exaggerated
until
he
looked
like
one
of
the
giants
of
ancient
mythology
robert
was
quite
sure
the
siege
would
never
be
raised
if
the
voice
of
the
ojibway
prevailed
in
the
allied
french
and
indian
councils
tandakora
had
been
wounded
twice
once
by
the
hunter
and
once
by
the
onondaga
and
a
mind
already
inflamed
against
the
americans
and
the
hodenosaunee
cherished
a
bitter
personal
hate
robert
knew
that
willet
tayoga
and
he
must
be
eternally
on
guard
against
his
murderous
attacks
the
savages
built
their
fires
higher
as
if
in
defiance
and
triumph
they
could
defend
themselves
against
cold
because
the
forest
furnished
unending
fuel
but
rain
or
hail
sleet
or
snow
would
bring
severe
hardship
the
day
however
favored
them
to
the
utmost
it
had
seemed
at
dawn
that
it
could
not
be
more
brilliant
but
as
the
morning
advanced
the
world
fairly
glowed
with
color
the
sky
was
golden
save
in
the
east
where
it
burned
in
red
and
the
trunks
and
black
boughs
of
the
forest
to
the
last
and
least
little
twig
were
touched
with
it
until
they
too
were
clothed
in
a
luminous
glow
the
besiegers
seemed
lazy
but
robert
knew
that
the
watch
upon
the
fort
and
its
approaches
was
never
neglected
for
an
instant
a
fox
could
not
steal
through
their
lines
unseen
and
yet
he
never
doubted
tayoga
would
come
and
moreover
he
would
come
at
the
time
appointed
toward
the
middle
of
the
morning
the
indians
shot
some
arrows
that
fell
inside
the
palisade
and
uttered
a
shout
or
two
of
defiance
but
nobody
was
hurt
and
nobody
was
stirred
to
action
the
demonstration
passed
unanswered
and
after
a
while
wilton
called
roberts
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
only
two
hours
until
noon
robert
did
not
reply
but
he
knew
that
the
conditions
could
not
be
more
unfavorable
rain
or
hail
sleet
or
snow
might
cover
the
passage
of
a
warrior
but
the
dazzling
sunlight
that
enlarged
twigs
two
hundred
yards
away
into
boughs
seemed
to
make
all
such
efforts
vain
yet
he
knew
tayoga
and
he
still
believed
soon
a
stir
came
in
the
forest
and
they
heard
a
long
droning
chant
a
dozen
warriors
appeared
coming
out
of
the
north
and
they
were
welcomed
with
shouts
by
the
others
hurons
i
think
said
willet
yes
im
sure
of
it
theyve
undoubtedly
sent
away
for
help
and
its
probable
that
other
bands
will
come
about
this
time
he
reckoned
right
as
in
half
an
hour
a
detachment
of
abenakis
came
and
they
too
were
received
with
approving
shouts
after
which
food
was
given
to
them
and
they
sat
luxuriously
before
the
fires
then
three
runners
arrived
one
from
the
north
one
from
the
west
and
one
from
the
east
and
a
great
shout
of
welcome
was
uttered
for
each
what
does
it
mean
wilton
asked
robert
the
runners
were
sent
out
by
de
courcelles
and
tandakora
to
rally
more
strength
for
our
siege
theyve
returned
with
the
news
that
fresh
forces
are
coming
as
the
exultant
shout
from
the
warriors
proves
the
young
philadelphians
heart
sank
he
knew
that
it
was
only
a
half
hour
until
noon
and
noon
was
the
appointed
time
nor
did
the
heavens
give
any
favoring
sign
the
whole
mighty
vault
was
a
blaze
of
gold
and
blue
nothing
could
stir
in
such
a
light
and
remain
hidden
from
the
warriors
wilton
looked
at
his
comrade
and
he
caught
a
sudden
glitter
in
his
eyes
it
was
not
the
look
of
one
who
despaired
instead
it
was
a
flash
of
triumph
and
the
young
philadelphian
wondered
had
robert
seen
a
sign
a
sign
that
had
escaped
all
others
he
searched
the
forest
everywhere
with
his
own
eyes
but
he
could
detect
nothing
unusual
there
were
the
french
and
there
were
the
indians
there
were
the
new
warriors
and
there
were
the
three
runners
resting
by
the
fires
the
runners
rose
presently
and
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
north
talked
with
tandakora
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
west
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
forest
with
an
abenaki
chief
and
looked
at
the
fort
the
one
who
had
come
out
of
the
east
joined
de
courcelles
himself
and
they
came
nearer
to
the
fort
than
any
of
the
others
although
they
remained
just
beyond
rifle
shot
evidently
de
courcelles
was
explaining
something
to
the
indian
as
once
he
pointed
toward
the
blockhouse
wilton
heard
robert
beside
him
draw
a
deep
breath
and
he
turned
in
surprise
the
face
of
young
lennox
was
tense
and
his
eyes
fairly
blazed
as
he
gazed
at
de
courcelles
and
the
warrior
then
looking
back
at
the
forest
robert
uttered
a
sudden
sharp
ah
the
release
of
uncontrollable
emotion
snapping
like
a
pistol
shot
did
you
see
it
will
did
you
see
it
he
exclaimed
it
was
quicker
than
lightning
the
indian
runner
stooped
snatched
the
pistol
from
the
belt
of
de
courcelles
struck
him
such
a
heavy
blow
on
the
head
with
the
butt
of
it
that
he
fell
without
a
sound
and
then
his
brown
body
shot
forward
like
an
arrow
for
the
fort
open
the
gate
open
the
gate
thundered
willet
and
strong
arms
unbarred
it
and
flung
it
back
in
an
instant
the
brown
body
of
tayoga
flashed
through
and
in
another
instant
it
was
closed
and
barred
again
he
is
here
with
five
minutes
to
spare
said
robert
as
he
left
the
palisade
with
wilton
and
went
toward
the
blockhouse
to
greet
his
friend
tayoga
painted
like
a
micmac
and
stooping
somewhat
hitherto
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
held
out
his
hand
in
the
white
mans
fashion
to
robert
while
his
eyes
usually
so
calm
showed
a
passing
gleam
of
triumph
i
said
tayoga
that
you
would
be
back
on
time
that
is
by
noon
today
said
robert
and
though
the
task
has
been
hard
youre
with
us
and
you
have
a
few
minutes
to
spare
how
did
you
deceive
the
sharp
eyes
of
tandakora
i
did
not
let
him
see
me
knowing
he
would
look
through
my
disguise
but
i
asked
the
french
colonel
to
come
forward
with
me
at
once
and
inspect
the
fort
knowing
that
it
was
my
only
chance
to
enter
here
and
he
agreed
to
do
so
you
saw
the
rest
and
thus
i
have
come
it
is
not
pleasant
to
those
who
besiege
us
as
your
ears
tell
you
fierce
yells
of
anger
and
disappointment
were
rising
in
the
forest
jumonville
and
two
french
soldiers
had
rushed
forward
seized
the
reviving
de
courcelles
and
were
carrying
him
to
one
of
the
fires
where
they
would
bind
up
his
injured
head
but
inside
the
fort
there
was
only
exultation
at
the
arrival
of
tayoga
and
admiration
for
his
skill
he
insisted
first
on
being
allowed
to
wash
off
the
micmac
paint
enabling
him
to
return
to
his
true
character
then
he
took
food
and
drink
tayoga
said
wilton
i
believed
you
could
not
come
i
said
so
often
to
lennox
you
would
never
have
known
my
belief
because
lennox
would
not
have
told
it
to
you
but
i
feel
that
i
must
apologize
to
you
for
the
thought
i
underrated
you
but
i
underrated
you
because
i
did
not
believe
any
human
being
could
do
what
you
have
done
tayoga
smiled
showing
his
splendid
white
teeth
your
thoughts
did
me
no
wrong
he
said
in
his
precise
school
english
because
the
elements
and
chance
itself
seemed
to
have
conspired
against
me
later
he
told
what
he
had
heard
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
where
the
sachems
and
chiefs
kept
themselves
well
informed
concerning
the
movements
of
the
belligerent
nations
the
french
were
still
the
more
active
of
the
rival
powers
and
their
energy
and
conquests
were
bringing
the
western
tribes
in
great
numbers
to
their
flag
throughout
the
ohio
country
the
warriors
were
on
the
side
of
the
french
who
were
continuing
the
construction
of
the
powerful
fortress
at
the
junction
of
the
alleghany
and
the
monongahela
the
french
were
far
down
in
the
province
of
new
york
and
they
held
control
of
lake
champlain
and
of
lake
george
also
more
settlements
had
been
cut
off
and
more
women
and
children
had
been
taken
prisoners
into
canada
but
the
british
colonies
and
great
britain
too
would
move
so
tayoga
said
they
were
slow
much
slower
than
canada
but
they
had
the
greater
strength
and
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
knew
it
they
could
not
be
moved
from
their
attitude
of
friendliness
toward
the
english
and
the
mohawks
openly
espoused
the
english
side
the
american
franklin
was
very
active
and
a
great
movement
against
fort
duquesne
would
be
begun
although
it
might
not
start
until
next
spring
an
english
force
under
an
english
general
was
coming
across
the
sea
and
the
might
of
england
was
gathering
for
a
great
blow
the
onondaga
had
few
changes
in
the
situation
to
report
but
he
at
least
brought
news
of
the
outside
world
driving
away
from
the
young
soldiers
the
feeling
that
they
were
cut
off
from
the
human
race
wilton
was
present
when
he
was
telling
of
these
things
and
when
he
had
finished
robert
asked
how
did
you
make
your
way
through
the
great
snow
tayoga
it
is
well
to
think
long
before
of
difficulties
he
replied
last
year
when
the
winter
was
finished
i
hid
a
pair
of
snow
shoes
in
this
part
of
the
forest
and
when
the
deep
snow
came
i
found
them
and
used
them
robert
glanced
at
wilton
whose
eyes
were
widening
and
the
great
rain
and
flood
how
did
you
meet
that
obstacle
asked
robert
that
too
was
forethought
i
have
two
canoes
hidden
in
this
region
and
it
was
easy
to
reach
one
of
them
in
which
i
traveled
with
speed
and
comfort
until
i
could
use
it
no
longer
then
i
hid
it
away
again
that
it
might
help
me
another
time
and
what
did
you
do
when
the
hurricane
came
tearing
up
the
bushes
cutting
down
the
trees
and
making
the
forest
as
dangerous
as
if
it
were
being
showered
by
cannon
balls
i
crept
under
a
wide
ledge
of
stone
in
the
side
of
a
hill
where
i
lay
snug
dry
and
safe
wilton
looked
at
tayoga
and
robert
and
then
back
at
the
onondaga
is
this
wizardry
he
cried
no
replied
robert
then
its
singular
chance
nor
that
either
it
was
the
necessities
that
confronted
tayoga
in
the
face
of
varied
dangers
and
my
knowledge
of
what
he
would
be
likely
to
do
in
either
case
merely
a
rather
fortunate
use
of
the
reasoning
faculties
will
willet
who
had
come
in
smiled
dont
let
em
make
game
of
you
mr
wilton
he
said
but
theres
truth
in
what
robert
tells
you
he
understands
tayoga
so
thoroughly
that
he
knows
pretty
well
what
hell
do
in
every
crisis
after
the
onondaga
had
eaten
he
wrapped
himself
in
blankets
went
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
blockhouse
and
slept
twentyfour
hours
when
he
awoke
he
showed
no
signs
of
his
tremendous
journey
and
infinite
dangers
he
was
once
more
the
lithe
and
powerful
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
besiegers
meanwhile
undertook
no
movement
but
as
if
in
defiance
they
increased
the
fires
in
the
red
ring
around
the
fort
and
they
showed
themselves
ostentatiously
robert
several
times
saw
de
courcelles
with
a
thick
bandage
about
his
head
and
he
knew
that
the
frenchmans
mortification
and
rage
at
being
tricked
so
by
the
onondaga
must
be
intense
now
the
weather
began
to
grow
very
cold
again
and
robert
saw
the
number
of
tepees
in
the
forest
increase
the
indians
not
content
with
the
fires
were
providing
themselves
with
good
shelters
and
to
every
one
it
indicated
a
long
siege
there
was
neither
snow
nor
hail
but
clear
bitter
intense
cold
and
again
the
timbers
of
the
blockhouse
and
outbuildings
popped
as
they
contracted
under
the
lower
temperature
the
horses
were
pretty
well
sheltered
from
the
cold
and
willet
with
his
usual
foresight
had
suggested
before
the
siege
closed
in
that
a
great
deal
of
grass
be
cut
for
them
though
should
the
french
and
indians
hang
on
for
a
month
or
two
they
would
certainly
become
a
problem
food
for
the
men
would
last
indefinitely
but
a
time
might
arrive
when
none
would
be
left
for
the
horses
if
the
pinch
comes
said
willet
we
know
how
to
relieve
it
how
asked
colden
well
eat
the
horses
colden
made
a
wry
face
its
often
been
done
in
europe
said
the
hunter
at
the
famous
sieges
of
leyden
and
haarlem
when
the
dutch
held
out
so
long
against
the
spanish
theyd
have
been
glad
enough
to
have
had
horseflesh
i
look
ahead
again
said
robert
hiding
a
humorous
gleam
in
his
eyes
from
colden
and
i
see
a
number
of
young
men
behind
a
palisade
which
they
have
held
gallantly
for
months
they
come
mostly
from
philadelphia
and
they
call
themselves
quakers
they
are
thin
awfully
thin
terribly
thin
so
thin
that
there
is
scarcely
enough
to
make
a
circle
for
their
belts
they
have
not
eaten
for
four
days
and
they
are
about
to
kill
their
last
horse
when
he
is
gone
they
will
have
to
live
on
fresh
air
and
scenery
now
i
know
lennox
that
youre
drawing
on
your
imagination
and
that
youre
a
false
prophet
said
colden
i
hope
my
prediction
wont
come
true
and
i
dont
believe
it
will
said
robert
cheerfully
several
nights
later
when
there
was
no
moon
and
no
stars
willet
and
tayoga
slipped
out
of
the
fort
colden
was
much
opposed
to
their
going
fearing
for
their
lives
and
knowing
too
how
great
a
loss
they
would
be
if
they
were
taken
or
slain
but
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
showed
the
utmost
confidence
assuring
him
they
would
return
in
safety
colden
became
quite
uneasy
for
them
after
they
had
been
gone
some
hours
and
robert
although
he
refused
to
show
it
felt
a
trace
of
apprehension
he
knew
their
great
skill
in
the
forest
but
tandakora
was
a
master
of
woodcraft
too
and
the
frenchmen
also
were
experienced
and
alert
as
he
colden
wilton
and
carson
watched
at
the
palisade
he
was
in
fear
lest
a
triumphant
shout
from
the
indian
lines
would
show
that
the
hunter
and
the
onondaga
had
been
trapped
but
the
long
hours
passed
without
an
alarm
and
about
three
oclock
in
the
morning
two
shadows
appeared
at
the
palisade
and
whispered
to
them
robert
felt
great
relief
as
willet
and
tayoga
climbed
silently
over
were
half
frozen
said
the
hunter
take
us
into
the
blockhouse
and
over
the
fire
well
tell
you
all
weve
seen
they
always
kept
a
bed
of
live
coals
on
the
hearth
in
the
main
building
and
the
two
who
had
returned
bent
over
the
grateful
heat
warming
their
hands
and
faces
not
until
they
were
in
a
normal
physical
condition
did
colden
or
robert
ask
them
any
questions
and
then
willet
said
their
ring
about
the
fort
is
complete
but
in
the
darkness
we
were
able
to
slip
through
and
then
back
again
i
should
judge
that
they
have
at
least
three
hundred
warriors
and
tandakora
is
first
among
them
there
are
about
thirty
frenchmen
de
courcelles
has
taken
off
his
bandage
but
he
still
has
a
bruise
where
tayoga
struck
him
peeping
from
the
bushes
i
saw
him
and
his
face
has
grown
more
evil
it
was
evident
to
me
that
the
blow
of
tayoga
has
inflamed
his
mind
he
feels
mortified
and
humiliated
at
the
way
in
which
he
was
outwitted
and
as
tandakora
also
nurses
a
personal
hatred
against
us
its
likely
that
theyll
keep
up
the
siege
all
winter
if
they
think
in
the
end
they
can
get
us
their
camp
too
shows
increasing
signs
of
permanency
theyve
built
a
dozen
bark
huts
in
which
all
the
french
all
the
chiefs
and
some
of
the
warriors
sleep
and
there
are
skin
lodges
for
the
rest
oh
its
quite
a
village
and
theyve
accumulated
game
too
for
a
long
time
colden
looked
depressed
were
not
fulfilling
our
mission
he
said
weve
come
out
here
to
protect
the
settlers
on
the
border
and
give
them
a
place
of
refuge
instead
it
looks
as
if
wed
pass
the
winter
fighting
for
our
own
lives
i
think
i
have
a
plan
said
robert
who
had
been
very
thoughtful
what
is
it
asked
colden
i
remember
something
i
read
in
our
roman
history
in
the
school
at
albany
it
was
an
event
that
happened
a
tremendously
long
time
ago
but
i
fancy
its
still
useful
as
an
example
scipio
took
his
army
over
to
africa
to
meet
hannibal
and
one
night
his
men
set
fire
to
the
tents
of
the
carthaginians
they
destroyed
their
camp
created
a
terrible
tumult
and
inflicted
great
losses
tayogas
eyes
glistened
then
you
mean
he
said
that
we
are
to
burn
the
camp
of
the
french
and
their
allies
no
less
it
is
a
good
plan
if
great
bear
and
the
captain
agree
to
it
we
will
do
it
its
fearfully
risky
said
colden
if
great
bear
and
i
can
go
out
once
and
come
back
safely
said
tayoga
we
can
do
it
twice
the
young
captain
looked
at
willet
its
the
best
plan
said
the
hunter
robert
hasnt
read
his
roman
history
in
vain
then
its
agreed
said
colden
and
as
soon
as
another
night
as
dark
as
this
comes
well
try
it
the
plan
being
formed
they
waited
a
week
before
a
night
pitchy
black
arrived
chapter
vii
the
red
weapon
the
night
was
admirably
suited
to
their
purposeotherwise
they
would
not
have
dared
to
leave
fort
refugeand
willet
tayoga
and
robert
alone
undertook
the
task
wilton
carson
and
others
were
anxious
to
go
but
as
an
enterprise
of
such
great
danger
required
surpassing
skill
the
three
promptly
ruled
them
out
the
hunter
and
young
lennox
would
have
disguised
themselves
as
indians
but
as
they
did
not
have
any
paint
in
the
fort
they
were
compelled
to
go
forth
in
their
own
garb
the
cold
had
softened
greatly
and
as
heavy
clouds
had
come
with
it
there
was
promise
of
snow
which
in
truth
the
three
hoped
would
fall
since
it
would
be
an
admirable
cloak
for
their
purpose
but
in
any
event
theirs
was
to
be
a
perilous
path
and
colden
shook
hands
with
the
three
as
they
lowered
themselves
softly
from
the
palisade
come
back
he
whispered
if
you
find
the
task
too
dangerous
let
it
go
and
return
at
once
we
need
you
here
in
the
fort
well
come
back
as
victors
robert
replied
with
confidence
then
he
and
his
comrades
crouched
close
against
the
palisade
and
listened
the
indian
fires
showed
dimly
in
the
heavy
dusk
and
they
knew
that
sentinels
were
on
watch
in
the
woods
but
still
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
palisade
they
went
to
the
far
side
where
the
indian
line
was
thinner
then
they
dropped
to
hand
and
knee
and
crept
toward
the
forest
they
stopped
at
intervals
lying
flat
upon
the
ground
looking
with
all
their
eyes
and
listening
with
all
their
ears
they
saw
ahead
but
one
fire
apparently
about
four
hundred
yards
away
and
they
heard
only
a
light
damp
wind
rustling
the
dry
boughs
and
bushes
but
they
knew
they
could
not
afford
to
relax
their
caution
by
a
hair
and
they
continued
a
slow
creeping
progress
until
they
reached
the
woods
then
they
rested
on
their
elbows
in
a
thicket
and
took
long
breaths
of
relief
they
had
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
crossing
the
open
and
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
sit
up
again
they
kept
very
close
together
while
their
muscles
recovered
elasticity
and
still
used
their
eyes
and
ears
to
the
utmost
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
a
warrior
was
not
near
crouching
in
the
thicket
as
they
were
and
they
did
not
intend
to
run
any
useless
risk
moreover
if
the
alarm
were
raised
now
they
would
escape
into
the
fort
and
await
another
chance
but
they
neither
heard
nor
saw
a
hostile
presence
in
truth
they
saw
nothing
that
betokened
a
siege
save
the
dim
light
flickering
several
hundred
yards
ahead
of
them
and
they
resumed
their
advance
bent
so
low
that
they
could
drop
flat
at
the
first
menace
their
eyes
looked
continually
for
a
sentinel
but
they
saw
none
dont
you
think
the
wind
is
rising
a
bit
tayoga
whispered
the
hunter
yes
replied
the
onondaga
and
it
feels
damper
to
the
face
yes
great
bear
and
it
doesnt
mean
rain
because
the
airs
too
cold
but
it
does
mean
snow
for
which
the
air
is
just
right
and
i
think
its
coming
as
the
clouds
grow
thicker
and
thicker
all
the
time
which
proves
that
we
are
favored
tododaho
from
his
great
and
shining
star
that
we
cannot
see
tonight
looks
down
upon
us
and
will
help
us
since
we
have
tried
to
do
the
things
that
are
right
we
wish
the
snow
to
come
because
we
wish
a
veil
about
us
while
we
confound
our
enemies
and
tododaho
will
send
it
he
spoke
devoutly
and
robert
admired
and
respected
his
faith
the
center
of
which
was
manitou
and
manitou
in
the
mind
of
the
christian
boy
was
the
same
as
god
he
also
shared
the
faith
of
tayoga
that
tododaho
would
wrap
the
snow
like
a
white
robe
about
them
to
hide
them
from
their
enemies
meanwhile
the
three
crept
slowly
toward
the
fire
and
robert
felt
something
damp
brush
his
face
it
was
the
first
flake
of
snow
and
tododaho
on
his
shining
star
was
keeping
his
unspoken
promise
tayoga
looked
up
toward
the
point
in
the
heavens
where
the
great
chiefs
star
shone
on
clear
nights
and
even
in
the
dark
robert
saw
the
spiritual
exaltation
on
his
face
the
onondaga
never
doubted
for
an
instant
the
mighty
chief
who
had
gone
away
four
centuries
ago
had
answered
the
prayer
made
to
him
by
one
of
his
loyal
children
and
was
sending
the
snow
that
it
might
be
a
veil
before
them
while
they
destroyed
the
camp
of
their
enemies
the
soul
of
tayoga
leaped
up
they
had
received
a
sign
they
were
in
the
care
of
tododaho
and
they
could
not
fail
another
flake
fell
on
roberts
face
and
a
third
followed
and
then
they
came
down
in
a
white
and
gentle
stream
that
soon
covered
him
willet
and
tayoga
and
hung
like
a
curtain
before
them
he
looked
back
toward
the
fort
but
the
veil
there
also
hung
between
and
he
could
not
see
it
then
he
looked
again
and
the
dim
fire
had
disappeared
in
the
white
mist
will
it
keep
their
huts
and
lodges
from
burning
he
whispered
to
the
hunter
willet
shook
his
head
if
we
get
a
fire
started
well
he
said
the
snow
will
seem
to
feed
it
rather
than
put
it
out
its
going
to
help
us
in
more
ways
than
one
too
id
expected
that
wed
have
to
use
flint
and
steel
to
touch
off
our
blaze
but
as
theyre
likely
to
leave
their
own
fire
and
seek
shelter
maybe
we
can
get
a
torch
there
now
you
two
boys
keep
close
to
me
and
well
approach
that
fire
or
the
place
where
it
was
they
continued
a
cautious
advance
their
moccasins
making
no
sound
in
the
soft
snow
all
objects
invisible
at
a
distance
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
yet
they
saw
one
indian
warrior
on
watch
although
he
did
not
see
or
hear
them
he
was
under
the
boughs
of
a
small
tree
and
was
crouched
against
the
trunk
protecting
himself
as
well
as
he
could
from
the
tumbling
flakes
he
was
a
huron
a
capable
warrior
with
his
five
senses
developed
well
and
in
normal
times
he
was
ambitious
and
eager
for
distinction
in
his
wilderness
world
but
just
now
he
did
not
dream
that
any
one
from
the
fort
could
be
near
so
the
three
passed
him
unsuspected
and
drew
close
to
the
fire
which
now
showed
as
a
white
glow
through
the
dusk
sufficient
proof
that
it
was
still
burning
further
progress
proved
that
the
warriors
had
abandoned
it
for
shelter
and
they
left
the
next
task
to
tayoga
the
onondaga
lay
down
in
the
snow
and
crept
forward
until
he
reached
the
fire
where
he
paused
and
waited
two
or
three
minutes
to
see
that
his
presence
was
not
detected
then
he
took
three
burning
sticks
and
passed
them
back
swiftly
to
his
comrades
willet
had
already
discerned
the
outline
of
a
bark
hut
on
his
right
and
robert
had
made
out
another
on
his
left
just
beyond
were
skin
tepees
they
must
now
act
quickly
and
each
went
upon
his
chosen
way
robert
approached
the
hut
on
the
left
from
the
rear
and
applied
the
torch
to
the
wall
which
was
made
of
dry
and
seasoned
bark
despite
the
snow
it
ignited
at
once
and
burned
with
extraordinary
speed
the
roar
of
flames
from
the
right
showed
that
the
hunter
had
done
as
well
and
a
light
flash
among
the
skin
tepees
was
proof
that
tayoga
was
not
behind
them
the
besieging
force
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
the
three
had
imitated
to
perfection
the
classic
example
of
scipios
soldiers
in
the
carthaginian
camp
the
confusion
was
terrible
as
french
and
indians
rushed
for
their
lives
from
the
burning
huts
and
lodges
into
the
blinding
snow
where
they
saw
little
and
for
the
present
understood
less
tayoga
who
in
the
white
dusk
readily
passed
for
one
of
their
own
slipped
here
and
there
continually
setting
new
fires
traveling
in
a
circle
about
the
fort
while
robert
and
willet
kept
near
him
but
on
the
inner
side
of
the
circle
and
well
behind
the
veil
of
snow
the
huts
and
lodges
burned
fiercely
where
they
stood
thickest
each
became
a
lofty
pyramid
of
fire
and
then
blended
into
a
mighty
mass
of
flames
forming
an
intense
red
core
in
the
white
cloud
of
falling
snow
french
soldiers
and
indian
warriors
ran
about
seeking
to
save
their
arms
ammunition
and
stores
but
they
were
not
always
successful
several
explosions
showed
that
the
flames
had
reached
powder
and
robert
laughed
to
himself
in
pleasure
the
destruction
of
their
powder
was
a
better
result
than
he
had
hoped
or
foreseen
the
hunter
uttered
a
low
whistle
and
tayoga
throwing
down
his
torch
at
once
joined
him
and
robert
who
had
already
cast
theirs
far
from
them
back
to
the
fort
said
willet
weve
already
done
em
damage
they
cant
repair
in
a
long
time
and
maybe
weve
broken
up
their
camp
for
the
winter
what
a
godsend
the
snow
was
it
was
tododaho
who
sent
it
said
tayoga
reverently
they
almost
make
a
red
ring
around
our
fort
we
have
succeeded
because
the
mighty
chief
the
founder
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
who
went
away
to
his
star
four
centuries
ago
willed
for
us
to
succeed
how
splendidly
the
fires
burn
not
a
hut
not
a
lodge
will
be
left
and
its
time
for
us
to
be
going
said
the
hunter
men
like
de
courcelles
jumonville
and
tandakora
will
soon
bring
order
out
of
all
that
tumult
and
theyll
be
looking
for
those
who
set
the
torch
the
snow
is
coming
down
heavier
and
heavier
and
it
hides
our
flight
although
it
is
not
able
to
put
out
the
fires
youre
right
tayoga
about
tododaho
pouring
his
favor
upon
us
it
was
easy
for
the
three
to
regain
the
palisade
and
they
were
not
afraid
of
mistaken
bullets
fired
at
them
for
enemies
since
colden
and
wilton
had
warned
the
soldiers
that
they
might
expect
the
return
of
the
three
tododaho
continued
to
watch
over
them
as
they
reached
the
palisade
at
the
point
where
the
young
philadelphia
captain
himself
stood
upon
the
raised
plank
behind
it
captain
colden
captain
colden
called
willet
through
the
white
cloud
is
it
you
mr
willet
exclaimed
colden
thank
god
youve
come
ive
been
in
great
fear
for
you
i
knew
that
you
had
set
the
fires
because
my
own
eyes
tell
me
so
but
i
didnt
know
what
had
become
of
you
im
here
safe
and
well
and
mr
lennox
here
unhurt
too
replied
robert
and
the
onondaga
all
right
and
rejoicing
that
we
have
done
even
more
than
we
hoped
to
do
said
tayoga
in
his
measured
and
scholastic
english
the
three
coated
with
snow
until
they
looked
like
white
bears
quickly
scaled
the
wall
and
received
the
joyous
welcome
given
to
those
who
have
done
a
great
deed
and
who
return
unhurt
to
their
comrades
colden
wilton
and
carson
shook
their
hands
again
and
again
and
robert
knew
that
it
was
due
as
much
to
pleasure
at
the
return
as
at
the
destruction
of
the
besieging
camp
the
entire
population
of
fort
refuge
was
at
the
palisade
heedless
of
the
snow
watching
the
burning
huts
and
lodges
there
was
no
wind
but
cinders
and
ashes
fell
near
them
to
be
covered
quickly
with
white
fierce
yells
now
came
from
the
forest
and
arrows
and
bullets
were
fired
at
the
fort
but
they
were
harmless
and
the
defenders
did
not
reply
the
flames
began
to
decline
by
and
by
then
they
sank
fast
and
after
a
while
the
snow
which
still
came
down
as
if
it
meant
never
to
stop
covered
everything
the
circling
white
wall
enveloped
the
stronghold
completely
and
robert
knew
that
the
disaster
to
the
french
and
indians
had
been
overwhelming
probably
all
of
them
had
saved
their
lives
but
they
had
lost
ammunitionthe
explosions
had
told
him
thatmuch
of
their
stores
and
doubtless
all
of
their
food
they
would
have
to
withdraw
for
the
present
at
least
robert
felt
immense
exultation
they
had
struck
a
great
blow
and
it
was
he
who
had
suggested
the
plan
his
pride
increased
although
he
hid
it
when
willet
put
his
large
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
twas
well
done
robert
my
lad
and
twould
not
have
been
done
at
all
had
it
not
been
for
you
your
mind
bred
the
idea
from
which
the
action
flowed
and
you
think
the
french
and
indians
have
gone
away
now
surely
lad
surely
indians
can
stand
a
lot
and
so
can
french
but
neither
can
stand
still
in
the
middle
of
a
snow
that
bids
fair
to
be
two
feet
deep
and
live
they
may
have
to
travel
until
they
reach
some
indian
village
farther
west
and
north
such
being
the
case
there
can
be
no
pressing
need
for
me
just
at
present
and
i
think
i
shall
sleep
i
feel
now
as
if
i
were
bound
to
relax
the
best
thing
you
could
do
and
ill
take
a
turn
between
the
blankets
myself
robert
had
a
great
sleep
some
of
the
rooms
in
the
blockhouse
offered
a
high
degree
of
frontier
comfort
and
he
lay
down
upon
a
soft
couch
of
skins
a
fine
fire
blazing
upon
a
stone
hearth
dried
his
deerskin
garments
and
when
he
awoke
about
noon
he
was
strong
and
thoroughly
refreshed
the
snow
was
still
falling
heavily
the
wilderness
in
its
white
blanket
was
beautiful
but
it
did
not
look
like
a
possible
home
to
robert
now
his
vivid
imagination
leaped
up
at
once
and
pictured
the
difficulties
of
any
one
struggling
for
life
even
in
that
vast
white
silence
willet
and
tayoga
were
up
before
him
and
they
were
talking
of
another
expedition
to
see
how
far
the
besieging
force
had
gone
but
while
they
were
discussing
it
a
figure
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
its
a
white
man
exclaimed
wilton
and
so
it
must
be
one
of
the
frenchmen
hes
a
bold
fellow
walking
directly
within
our
range
what
on
earth
can
he
want
one
of
the
guards
on
the
palisade
raised
his
rifle
but
willet
promptly
pushed
down
the
muzzle
thats
no
frenchman
he
said
then
who
is
it
asked
wilton
hes
clothed
in
white
as
any
one
walking
in
this
snow
is
bound
to
be
but
i
could
tell
at
the
first
glimpse
that
it
was
none
other
than
our
friend
black
rifle
coming
to
us
for
refuge
and
so
our
fort
is
well
named
not
for
refuge
black
rifle
has
taken
care
of
himself
too
long
in
the
wilderness
to
be
at
a
loss
at
any
time
i
suspect
that
he
has
something
of
importance
to
tell
us
or
he
would
not
come
at
all
at
the
command
of
colden
the
great
gate
was
thrown
open
that
the
strange
rover
might
enter
in
all
honor
and
as
he
came
in
apparently
oblivious
of
the
storm
his
eyes
gleamed
a
little
at
the
sight
of
willet
his
friend
youve
come
to
tell
us
something
said
the
hunter
so
i
have
said
black
rifle
brush
off
the
snow
warm
yourself
by
the
fire
and
then
well
listen
i
can
tell
it
now
i
dont
mind
the
snow
i
saw
from
a
distance
the
great
fire
last
night
when
the
camp
of
the
french
and
indians
burned
it
was
clever
to
destroy
their
huts
and
lodges
and
i
knew
at
once
who
did
it
such
a
thing
as
that
could
not
have
happened
without
you
having
a
hand
in
it
dave
willet
i
watched
to
see
what
the
french
and
indians
would
do
and
i
followed
them
in
their
hurried
retreat
into
the
north
i
hid
in
the
snowy
bushes
and
heard
some
of
their
talk
too
they
will
not
stop
until
they
reach
a
village
a
full
hundred
miles
from
here
the
frenchmen
de
courcelles
and
jumonville
are
mad
with
anger
and
disappointment
and
so
is
the
indian
chief
tandakora
and
well
they
may
be
jubilantly
exclaimed
captain
colden
off
whose
mind
a
great
weight
seemed
to
have
slid
it
was
splendid
tactics
to
burn
their
home
over
their
heads
i
wouldnt
have
thought
of
it
myself
but
since
others
have
thought
of
it
and
it
has
succeeded
so
admirably
we
can
now
do
the
work
we
were
sent
here
to
do
tayoga
and
willet
made
snowshoes
and
went
out
on
them
a
few
days
later
confirming
the
report
of
black
rifle
then
small
parties
were
sent
forth
to
search
the
forest
for
settlers
and
their
families
robert
had
a
large
share
in
this
work
and
sometimes
he
looked
upon
terrible
things
in
more
than
one
place
torch
and
tomahawk
had
already
done
their
dreadful
work
but
in
others
they
found
the
people
alive
and
well
still
clinging
to
their
homes
it
was
often
difficult
even
in
the
face
of
imminent
danger
to
persuade
them
to
leave
and
when
they
finally
went
under
mild
compulsion
it
was
with
the
resolve
to
return
to
their
log
cabins
in
the
spring
fort
refuge
now
deserved
its
name
there
were
many
axes
with
plenty
of
strong
and
skillful
arms
to
wield
them
and
new
buildings
were
erected
within
the
palisade
the
smoke
rising
from
a
half
dozen
chimneys
they
were
rude
structures
but
the
people
who
occupied
them
used
all
their
lives
to
hardships
did
not
ask
much
and
they
seemed
snug
and
comfortable
enough
to
them
fires
always
blazed
on
the
broad
stone
hearths
and
the
voices
of
children
were
heard
within
the
log
walls
the
hands
of
women
furnished
the
rooms
and
made
new
clothes
of
deerskin
the
note
of
life
at
fort
refuge
was
comfort
and
good
cheer
they
felt
that
they
could
hold
the
little
fortress
against
any
force
that
might
come
the
hunters
willet
tayoga
and
black
rifle
at
their
head
brought
in
an
abundance
of
game
there
was
no
ill
health
the
little
children
grew
mightily
and
thus
thrown
together
in
a
group
they
had
the
happiest
time
they
had
ever
known
robert
was
their
hero
no
other
could
tell
such
glorious
tales
he
had
read
fairy
stories
at
albany
and
he
not
only
brought
them
all
from
the
store
of
his
memory
but
he
embroidered
and
enlarged
them
he
had
a
manner
with
him
too
his
musical
golden
voice
his
vivid
eyes
and
his
intense
earnestness
of
tone
the
same
that
had
impressed
so
greatly
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
carried
conviction
if
one
telling
a
tale
believed
in
it
so
thoroughly
himself
then
those
who
heard
it
must
believe
in
it
too
robert
fulfilled
a
great
mission
he
was
not
the
orator
the
golden
mouthed
for
nothing
if
the
winter
came
down
a
little
too
fiercely
his
vivid
eyes
and
gay
voice
were
sufficient
to
lift
the
depression
even
the
somber
face
of
black
rifle
would
light
up
when
he
came
near
nor
was
the
young
quaker
wilton
far
behind
him
he
was
a
spontaneously
happy
youth
always
bubbling
with
good
nature
and
he
formed
an
able
second
for
lennox
will
said
robert
i
believe
it
actually
gives
you
joy
to
be
here
in
this
log
fortress
in
the
snow
and
wilderness
you
do
not
miss
the
great
capital
philadelphia
to
which
you
have
been
used
all
your
life
no
i
dont
robert
i
like
fort
refuge
because
im
free
from
restraints
its
the
first
time
my
true
nature
has
had
a
chance
to
come
out
and
im
making
the
most
of
the
opportunity
oh
im
developing
in
the
spring
youll
see
me
the
gayest
and
most
reckless
blade
that
ever
came
into
the
forest
the
deep
snow
lasted
a
long
time
more
snowshoes
were
made
but
only
six
or
eight
of
the
soldiers
learned
to
use
them
well
there
were
sufficient
however
as
willet
robert
tayoga
and
black
rifle
were
already
adepts
and
they
ranged
the
forest
far
in
all
directions
they
saw
no
further
sign
of
french
or
indians
but
they
steadily
increased
their
supply
of
game
christmas
came
january
passed
and
then
the
big
snow
began
to
melt
new
stirrings
entered
roberts
mind
he
felt
that
their
work
at
fort
refuge
was
done
they
had
gathered
into
it
all
the
outlying
settlers
who
could
be
reached
and
colden
wilton
and
carson
were
now
entirely
competent
to
guard
it
and
hold
it
robert
felt
that
he
and
willet
should
return
to
albany
and
get
into
the
main
current
of
the
great
war
tayoga
of
course
would
go
with
them
he
talked
it
over
with
willet
and
tayoga
and
they
agreed
with
him
at
once
black
rifle
also
decided
to
depart
about
the
same
time
and
colden
although
grieved
to
see
them
go
could
say
nothing
against
it
when
the
four
left
they
received
an
ovation
that
would
have
warmed
the
heart
of
any
man
as
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
with
their
packs
on
their
backs
captain
colden
gave
a
sharp
command
sixty
rifles
turned
their
muzzles
upward
and
sixty
fingers
pulled
sixty
triggers
sixty
weapons
roared
as
one
and
the
four
with
dew
in
their
eyes
lifted
their
caps
to
the
splendid
salute
then
a
long
shrill
cheer
followed
every
child
in
the
fort
had
been
lifted
above
the
palisade
and
they
sent
the
best
wishes
of
their
hearts
with
those
who
were
going
that
cheer
of
the
little
ones
was
mostly
for
you
robert
said
willet
when
the
forest
hid
them
it
was
for
all
of
us
equally
said
robert
modestly
no
im
right
and
it
must
help
us
to
have
the
good
wishes
of
little
children
go
with
us
if
they
and
tododaho
watch
over
us
we
cant
come
to
much
harm
it
is
a
good
omen
said
tayoga
soberly
when
i
lie
down
to
sleep
tonight
i
shall
hear
their
voices
in
my
ear
black
rifle
now
left
them
going
on
one
of
his
solitary
expeditions
into
the
wilderness
and
the
others
traveled
diligently
all
the
day
but
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
earth
did
not
make
their
usual
progress
most
of
the
snow
had
melted
and
everything
was
dripping
with
water
it
fell
from
every
bough
and
twig
and
in
every
ravine
and
gully
a
rivulet
was
running
while
ponds
stood
in
every
depression
many
swollen
brooks
and
creeks
had
to
be
forded
and
when
night
came
they
were
wet
and
soaked
to
the
waist
but
tayoga
then
achieved
a
great
triumph
in
the
face
of
difficulties
that
seemed
insuperable
he
coaxed
a
fire
in
the
lee
of
a
hill
and
the
three
fed
it
until
it
threw
out
a
great
circle
of
heat
in
which
they
warmed
and
dried
themselves
when
they
had
eaten
and
rested
a
long
time
they
put
out
the
fire
waited
for
the
coals
and
ashes
to
cool
and
then
spread
over
them
their
blankets
thus
securing
a
dry
base
upon
which
to
sleep
they
were
so
thoroughly
exhausted
and
they
were
so
sure
that
the
forest
contained
no
hostile
presence
that
all
three
went
to
sleep
at
the
same
time
and
remained
buried
in
slumber
throughout
the
night
tayoga
was
the
first
to
awake
and
he
saw
the
dawn
of
a
new
winter
day
the
earth
reeking
with
cold
damp
and
the
thawing
snow
he
unrolled
himself
from
his
blankets
and
arose
a
little
stiffly
but
with
a
few
movements
of
the
limbs
all
his
flexibility
returned
the
air
was
chill
and
the
scene
in
the
black
forest
of
winter
was
desolate
but
tayoga
was
happy
tododaho
on
his
great
shining
star
had
watched
over
him
and
showered
him
with
favors
and
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
remain
under
the
protection
of
the
mighty
chief
who
had
gone
away
so
long
ago
tayoga
looked
down
at
his
comrades
who
still
slept
soundly
and
smiled
the
three
were
bound
together
by
powerful
ties
and
the
events
of
recent
months
had
made
them
stronger
than
ever
in
the
school
at
albany
he
had
absorbed
much
of
the
white
mans
education
and
while
his
indian
nature
remained
unchanged
he
understood
also
the
white
point
of
view
he
could
meet
both
robert
and
willet
on
common
ground
and
theirs
was
a
friendship
that
could
not
be
severed
now
he
made
a
circle
about
their
camp
and
being
assured
that
no
enemy
was
near
came
back
to
the
point
where
robert
and
willet
yet
slept
then
he
took
his
flint
and
steel
and
withdrawing
a
little
kindled
a
fire
doing
so
as
quietly
as
he
could
in
order
that
the
two
awaking
might
have
a
pleasant
surprise
when
the
little
flames
were
licking
the
wood
and
the
sparks
began
to
fly
upwards
he
shook
robert
by
the
shoulder
arise
sluggard
he
said
did
not
our
teacher
in
albany
tell
us
it
was
proof
of
a
lazy
nature
to
sleep
while
the
sun
was
rising
the
fire
even
has
grown
impatient
and
has
lighted
itself
while
you
abode
with
tarenyawagon
the
sender
of
dreams
get
up
and
cook
our
breakfast
oh
heavy
head
robert
sat
up
and
so
did
willet
then
robert
drew
his
blankets
about
his
body
and
lay
down
again
youve
done
so
well
with
the
fire
tayoga
and
youve
shown
such
a
spirit
he
said
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
interfere
with
your
activity
go
ahead
and
awake
me
again
when
breakfast
is
ready
tayoga
made
a
rush
seized
the
edge
of
his
blanket
and
unrolled
it
depositing
robert
in
the
ashes
then
he
darted
away
among
the
bushes
avoiding
the
white
youths
pursuit
willet
meanwhile
warmed
himself
by
the
fire
and
laughed
come
back
you
two
he
said
you
think
youre
little
lads
again
at
your
school
in
albany
but
youre
not
youre
here
in
the
wilderness
confronted
by
many
difficulties
all
of
which
you
can
overcome
and
subject
to
many
perils
all
of
which
you
know
how
to
avoid
ill
come
said
robert
if
you
promise
to
protect
me
from
this
fierce
onondaga
chief
who
is
trying
to
secure
my
scalp
tayoga
return
to
the
fire
and
cook
these
strips
of
venison
here
is
the
sharp
stick
left
from
last
night
robert
take
our
canteens
find
a
spring
and
fill
them
with
fresh
water
by
right
of
seniority
im
in
command
this
morning
and
i
intend
to
subject
my
army
to
extremely
severe
discipline
because
its
good
for
it
obey
at
once
tayoga
obediently
took
the
sharpened
stick
and
began
to
fry
strips
of
venison
robert
the
canteens
over
his
shoulder
found
a
spring
near
by
and
refilled
them
like
tayoga
the
raw
chill
of
the
morning
and
the
desolate
forest
of
winter
had
no
effect
upon
him
he
too
was
happy
uplifted
and
he
sang
to
himself
the
song
he
had
heard
de
galissonniere
sing
hier
sur
le
pont
davignon
jai
oui
chanter
la
belle
lon
la
jai
oui
chanter
la
belle
elle
chantait
dun
ton
si
doux
comme
une
demoiselle
lon
la
comme
une
demoiselle
all
that
seemed
far
away
now
yet
the
words
of
the
song
brought
it
back
and
his
extraordinary
imagination
made
the
scenes
at
bigots
ball
pass
before
his
eyes
again
almost
as
vivid
as
reality
once
more
he
saw
the
intendant
his
portly
figure
swaying
in
the
dance
his
red
face
beaming
and
once
more
he
beheld
the
fiery
duel
in
the
garden
when
the
hunter
dealt
with
boucher
the
bully
and
bravo
quebec
was
far
away
he
had
been
glad
to
go
to
it
and
he
had
been
glad
to
come
away
too
he
would
be
glad
to
go
to
it
again
and
he
felt
that
he
would
do
so
some
day
though
the
torrent
of
battle
now
rolled
between
he
was
still
humming
the
air
when
he
came
back
to
the
fire
and
saluting
willet
politely
tendered
a
canteen
each
to
him
and
tayoga
sir
david
willet
baronet
and
general
he
said
i
have
the
honor
to
report
to
you
that
in
accordance
with
your
command
i
have
found
the
water
spring
water
fine
fresh
pure
as
good
as
any
the
northern
wilderness
can
furnish
and
that
is
the
best
in
the
world
shall
i
tender
it
to
you
sir
on
my
bended
knee
no
mr
lennox
we
can
dispense
with
the
bended
knee
but
i
am
glad
young
sir
to
note
in
your
voice
the
tone
of
deep
respect
for
your
elders
which
sometimes
and
sadly
is
lacking
if
dagaeoga
works
well
and
always
does
as
he
is
bidden
said
tayoga
perhaps
ill
let
him
look
on
at
the
ceremonies
when
i
take
my
place
as
one
of
the
fifteen
sachems
of
the
onondaga
nation
while
they
ate
their
venison
and
some
bread
they
had
also
brought
with
them
they
discussed
the
next
stage
of
their
journey
and
tayoga
made
a
suggestion
traveling
would
remain
difficult
for
several
days
and
instead
of
going
directly
to
albany
their
original
purpose
they
might
take
a
canoe
and
visit
mount
johnson
the
seat
of
colonel
william
johnson
who
was
such
a
power
with
the
hodenosaunee
and
who
was
in
his
person
a
center
of
important
affairs
in
north
america
for
a
while
mount
johnson
might
in
truth
suit
their
purpose
better
than
albany
the
idea
appealed
at
once
to
both
robert
and
willet
colonel
johnson
more
than
any
one
else
could
tell
them
what
to
do
and
owing
to
his
strong
alliance
marital
and
otherwise
with
the
mohawks
they
were
likely
to
find
chiefs
of
the
ganeagaono
at
his
house
or
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
agreed
said
willet
after
a
brief
discussion
if
my
calculations
be
correct
we
can
reach
mount
johnson
in
four
days
and
i
dont
think
were
likely
to
cross
the
trail
of
an
enemy
unless
st
luc
is
making
some
daring
expedition
in
any
event
hes
a
nobler
foe
than
de
courcelles
or
jumonville
said
robert
i
grant
you
that
readily
said
the
hunter
still
i
dont
think
were
likely
to
encounter
him
on
our
way
to
mount
johnson
but
on
the
second
day
they
did
cross
a
trail
which
they
attributed
to
a
hostile
force
it
contained
however
no
white
footsteps
and
not
pausing
to
investigate
they
continued
their
course
toward
their
destination
as
all
the
snow
was
now
gone
and
the
earth
was
drying
fast
they
were
able
almost
to
double
their
speed
and
they
pressed
forward
eager
to
see
the
celebrated
colonel
william
johnson
who
was
now
filling
and
who
was
destined
to
fill
for
so
long
a
time
so
large
a
place
in
the
affairs
of
north
america
chapter
viii
waraiyageh
now
a
few
pleasant
days
of
winter
came
the
ground
dried
under
comparatively
warm
winds
and
the
forest
awoke
they
heard
everywhere
the
ripple
of
running
water
and
wild
animals
came
out
of
their
dens
tayoga
shot
a
young
bear
which
made
a
welcome
addition
to
their
supplies
i
hold
that
theres
nothing
better
in
the
woods
than
young
bear
said
willet
as
he
ate
a
juicy
steak
robert
had
broiled
over
the
coals
venison
is
mighty
good
especially
so
when
youre
hungry
but
you
can
get
tired
of
it
what
say
you
tayoga
it
is
true
replied
the
onondaga
fat
young
bear
is
very
fine
none
of
us
wants
one
thing
all
the
time
and
we
want
something
besides
meat
too
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
are
great
and
civilized
much
ahead
of
the
other
red
people
because
they
plant
gardens
and
orchards
and
fields
and
have
grain
and
vegetables
corn
beans
squash
and
many
other
things
good
for
the
table
and
the
iroquois
while
they
grow
more
particular
about
the
table
remain
the
most
valiant
of
all
the
forest
people
i
see
your
point
tayoga
civilization
doesnt
take
anything
from
a
mans
courage
and
tenacity
rather
it
adds
to
them
there
are
our
enemies
the
french
who
are
as
brave
and
enduring
as
anybody
and
yet
theyre
the
best
cooks
in
the
world
and
more
particular
about
their
food
than
any
other
nation
you
always
speak
of
the
french
with
a
kind
of
affection
dave
said
robert
i
suppose
i
do
said
the
hunter
i
have
reasons
as
i
know
now
dave
youve
been
in
paris
cant
you
tell
us
something
about
the
city
its
the
finest
town
in
the
world
robert
and
theyve
the
brightest
gayest
life
there
at
least
a
part
of
em
have
but
things
are
not
going
right
at
home
with
the
french
they
say
a
whole
nations
fortune
has
been
sunk
in
the
palace
at
versailles
and
the
people
are
growing
poorer
all
the
time
but
the
government
hopes
to
dazzle
em
by
waging
a
successful
and
brilliant
war
over
here
i
repeat
though
robert
that
i
like
the
french
a
great
nation
sound
at
the
core
splendid
soldiers
as
were
seeing
and
as
were
likely
to
see
for
a
long
time
to
come
they
pushed
on
with
all
speed
toward
mount
johnson
the
weather
still
favoring
them
making
their
last
camp
in
a
fine
oak
grove
and
reckoning
that
they
would
achieve
their
journeys
end
before
noon
the
next
day
they
did
not
build
any
fire
that
night
but
when
they
rose
at
dawn
they
saw
the
smoke
of
somebody
elses
fire
on
the
eastern
horizon
it
couldnt
be
the
enemy
said
willet
he
wouldnt
let
his
smoke
go
up
here
for
all
the
world
to
see
so
near
to
the
home
of
colonel
william
johnson
and
within
the
range
of
the
mohawks
that
is
so
said
tayoga
it
is
likely
to
be
some
force
of
colonel
johnson
himself
and
we
can
advance
with
certainty
looking
well
to
their
arms
in
the
possible
contingency
of
a
foe
they
pushed
forward
through
the
woodland
the
smoke
growing
meanwhile
as
if
those
who
had
built
the
fire
either
felt
sure
of
friendly
territory
or
were
ready
to
challenge
the
world
the
onondaga
presently
held
up
a
hand
and
the
three
stopped
what
is
it
tayoga
asked
the
hunter
i
wish
to
sing
a
song
then
sing
it
tayoga
a
bird
suddenly
gave
forth
a
long
musical
thrilling
note
it
rose
in
a
series
of
trills
singularly
penetrating
and
died
away
in
a
haunting
echo
a
few
moments
of
silence
and
then
from
a
point
in
the
forest
in
front
of
them
another
bird
sang
a
like
song
they
are
friends
said
tayoga
who
was
the
first
bird
and
it
may
be
since
we
are
within
the
range
of
the
mohawks
that
it
is
our
friend
the
great
young
chief
daganoweda
who
replied
i
do
not
think
any
one
else
could
sing
a
song
so
like
my
own
im
wagering
that
its
daganoweda
and
nobody
else
said
willet
confidently
and
scorning
cover
now
they
advanced
at
increased
speed
toward
the
fire
a
splendid
figure
tall
heroic
the
nose
lofty
and
beaked
like
that
of
an
ancient
roman
the
feather
headdress
brilliant
and
defiant
like
that
of
tayoga
came
forward
to
meet
them
and
robert
saw
with
intense
pleasure
that
it
was
none
other
than
daganoweda
himself
nor
was
the
delight
of
the
young
mohawk
chieftain
any
lessthe
taciturnity
and
blank
faces
of
indians
disappeared
among
their
friendsand
he
came
forward
smiling
and
uttering
words
of
welcome
daganoweda
said
willet
the
sight
of
you
is
balm
to
the
eyes
your
name
means
in
our
language
the
inexhaustible
and
youre
an
inexhaustible
friend
youre
always
appearing
when
we
need
you
most
and
thats
the
very
finest
kind
of
a
friend
great
bear
tayoga
and
dagaeoga
come
out
of
the
great
wilderness
said
daganoweda
smiling
so
we
do
daganoweda
weve
been
there
a
long
time
but
we
were
not
so
idle
i
have
heard
of
the
fort
that
was
built
in
the
forest
and
how
the
young
white
soldiers
with
the
help
of
great
bear
tayoga
and
dagaeoga
beat
off
the
french
and
the
savage
tribes
i
supposed
that
runners
of
the
hodenosaunee
would
keep
you
informed
well
the
fort
is
there
and
our
people
still
hold
it
and
we
are
here
anxious
to
get
back
into
the
main
stream
of
big
events
who
are
at
the
fire
daganoweda
waraiyageh
colonel
william
johnson
himself
is
there
he
was
fishing
yesterday
it
being
an
idle
time
for
a
few
days
and
with
ten
of
my
warriors
i
joined
him
last
night
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
great
bear
whom
he
knows
and
he
will
be
glad
to
meet
tayoga
and
dagaeoga
who
are
to
bear
great
names
easy
daganoweda
easy
laughed
willet
these
are
fine
lads
but
dont
flatter
em
too
much
just
yet
theyve
done
brave
deeds
but
before
this
war
is
over
theyll
have
to
do
a
lot
more
well
go
with
you
and
meet
colonel
johnson
as
they
walked
toward
the
fire
a
tall
strongly
built
man
of
middle
years
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
english
officer
came
forward
to
meet
them
his
face
with
a
distinct
irish
cast
was
frank
open
and
resolute
ah
willet
my
friend
he
said
extending
his
hand
so
you
and
i
meet
again
and
glad
i
am
to
hold
your
fingers
in
mine
once
more
a
faithful
report
has
come
to
us
of
what
you
did
in
quebec
and
it
seems
the
willet
of
old
has
not
changed
much
the
hunter
reddened
under
his
tan
it
was
forced
upon
me
colonel
he
said
colonel
william
johnson
laughed
heartily
and
he
who
forced
it
did
not
live
to
regret
it
he
said
ive
heard
that
french
officers
themselves
did
not
blame
you
but
as
for
me
knowing
you
as
i
do
id
have
expected
no
less
of
david
willet
he
laughed
again
and
his
laugh
was
deep
and
hearty
robert
looking
closely
at
him
thought
him
a
fine
strong
man
and
he
was
quite
sure
he
would
like
him
the
colonel
glanced
at
him
and
tayoga
and
the
hunter
said
colonel
johnson
i
wish
to
present
tayoga
who
is
of
the
most
ancient
blood
of
the
onondagas
a
member
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
and
destined
to
be
a
great
chief
a
most
valiant
and
noble
youth
too
i
assure
you
and
the
white
lad
is
robert
lennox
to
whom
i
stand
in
the
place
of
a
father
i
have
heard
of
tayoga
said
colonel
johnson
and
his
people
and
mine
are
friends
it
is
true
said
tayoga
waraiyageh
has
been
the
best
friend
among
the
white
people
that
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
have
ever
had
he
has
never
tricked
us
he
has
never
lied
to
us
and
often
he
has
incurred
great
hardship
and
danger
to
help
us
it
is
pleasant
in
my
ears
to
hear
you
say
so
tayoga
said
colonel
johnson
and
as
for
mr
lennox
who
my
eyes
tell
me
is
also
a
noble
and
gallant
youth
it
seems
to
me
ive
heard
some
report
of
him
too
you
carried
the
private
letters
from
the
governor
of
new
york
to
the
marquis
duquesne
governor
general
of
canada
i
did
sir
replied
robert
and
of
course
you
were
there
with
willet
your
mission
i
believe
was
kept
as
secret
as
possible
but
i
learned
at
albany
that
you
bore
yourself
well
and
that
you
also
gave
an
exhibition
with
the
sword
it
was
roberts
turn
to
flush
im
a
poor
swordsman
sir
he
said
by
the
side
of
mr
willet
good
enough
though
for
the
occasion
but
come
ill
make
an
end
to
badinage
you
must
be
on
your
way
to
mount
johnson
that
was
our
destination
said
willet
then
right
welcome
guests
youll
be
i
have
a
little
camp
but
a
short
distance
away
molly
is
there
and
so
is
that
young
eagle
her
brother
joseph
brant
molly
will
see
that
youre
well
served
with
food
and
after
that
you
shall
stay
at
mount
johnson
as
long
as
you
like
and
the
longer
youll
stay
the
better
it
will
please
molly
and
me
you
shall
tell
us
of
your
adventures
mr
lennox
and
about
that
quebec
in
which
you
and
mr
willet
seem
to
have
cut
so
wide
a
swath
with
your
rapiers
we
did
but
meet
the
difficulties
that
were
forced
upon
us
protested
willet
colonel
johnson
laughed
once
more
and
most
heartily
if
all
people
met
in
like
fashion
the
difficulties
that
were
forced
upon
them
he
said
it
would
be
a
wondrous
efficient
world
so
much
superior
to
the
world
that
now
is
that
one
would
never
dream
they
had
been
the
same
but
just
beyond
the
hill
is
our
little
camp
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
ill
call
a
bower
here
is
joseph
now
coming
to
meet
us
an
indian
lad
of
about
eleven
years
but
large
and
uncommonly
strong
for
his
age
was
walking
down
the
hill
toward
them
he
was
dressed
partly
in
civilized
clothing
and
his
manner
was
such
that
he
would
have
drawn
the
notice
of
the
observing
anywhere
his
face
was
open
and
strong
with
great
width
between
the
eyes
and
his
gaze
was
direct
and
firm
robert
knew
at
once
that
here
was
an
unusual
boy
one
destined
if
he
lived
to
do
great
things
his
prevision
was
more
than
fulfilled
it
was
joseph
brant
the
renowned
thayendanegea
the
most
famous
and
probably
the
ablest
indian
chief
with
whom
the
white
men
ever
came
into
contact
this
is
joseph
brant
the
brother
of
molly
my
wife
and
hence
my
young
brotherinlaw
said
colonel
johnson
joseph
our
new
friends
are
david
willet
known
to
the
hodenosaunee
as
the
great
bear
robert
lennox
who
seems
to
be
in
some
sort
a
ward
of
mr
willet
and
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
your
great
brother
nation
onondaga
young
thayendanegea
saluted
them
all
in
a
friendly
but
dignified
way
he
like
tayoga
had
a
white
education
and
spoke
perfect
but
measured
english
we
welcome
you
he
said
colonel
johnson
sir
my
sister
has
already
seen
the
strangers
from
the
hill
and
is
anxious
to
greet
them
molly
for
all
her
dignity
has
her
fair
share
of
curiosity
laughed
colonel
johnson
and
since
its
our
duty
to
gratify
it
well
go
forward
robert
had
heard
often
of
molly
brant
the
famous
mohawk
wife
of
colonel
afterward
sir
william
johnson
a
great
figure
in
that
region
in
her
time
and
he
was
eager
to
see
her
he
beheld
a
woman
young
tall
a
face
decidedly
iroquois
but
handsome
and
lofty
she
wore
the
dress
of
the
white
people
and
it
was
of
fine
material
she
obviously
had
some
of
the
distinguished
character
that
had
already
set
its
seal
upon
her
young
brother
then
known
as
keghneghtada
his
famous
name
of
thayendanegea
to
come
later
her
husband
presented
the
three
and
she
received
them
in
turn
in
a
manner
that
was
quiet
and
dignified
although
robert
could
see
her
examining
them
with
swift
indian
eyes
that
missed
nothing
and
with
his
knowledge
of
both
white
heart
and
red
heart
of
white
manner
and
red
manner
he
was
aware
that
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
a
great
lady
a
great
lady
who
fitted
into
her
setting
of
the
vast
new
york
wilderness
so
with
the
ornate
manner
of
the
day
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
as
he
was
presented
madam
he
said
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
us
to
meet
colonel
johnson
here
in
the
forest
but
we
have
the
unexpected
and
still
greater
pleasure
of
meeting
his
lady
also
colonel
johnson
laughed
and
patted
robert
on
the
shoulder
mr
willet
has
been
whispering
to
me
something
about
you
he
said
he
has
been
telling
me
of
your
gift
of
speech
and
by
my
faith
he
has
not
told
all
of
it
you
do
address
the
ladies
in
a
most
graceful
fashion
and
molly
likes
it
i
can
see
that
assuredly
i
do
sir
said
she
who
had
been
molly
brant
the
mohawk
but
who
was
now
the
wife
of
the
greatest
man
in
the
north
country
tis
a
goodly
youth
and
he
speaks
well
i
like
him
and
he
shall
have
the
best
our
house
can
offer
colonel
johnsons
mellow
laugh
rang
out
again
spoken
like
a
woman
of
spirit
molly
he
said
i
expected
none
the
less
of
you
its
in
the
blood
of
the
ganeagaono
and
had
you
answered
otherwise
you
would
have
been
unworthy
of
your
cousin
daganoweda
here
the
young
mohawk
chieftain
smiled
johnson
who
had
married
a
girl
of
their
race
could
jest
with
the
mohawks
almost
as
he
pleased
and
among
themselves
and
among
those
whom
they
trusted
the
indians
were
fond
of
joking
and
laughter
the
wife
of
waraiyageh
not
only
has
a
great
chief
for
a
husband
he
said
but
she
is
a
great
chief
herself
among
the
wyandots
she
would
be
one
of
the
rulers
the
women
were
the
governing
power
in
the
valiant
wyandot
nation
and
daganoweda
could
pay
his
cousin
no
higher
compliment
we
talk
much
said
colonel
johnson
but
we
must
remember
that
our
friends
are
tired
theyve
come
afar
in
bad
weather
we
must
let
them
rest
now
and
give
them
refreshment
he
led
the
way
to
the
light
summer
house
that
he
had
called
a
bower
it
was
built
of
poles
and
thatch
and
was
open
on
the
eastern
side
where
it
faced
a
fine
creek
running
with
a
strong
current
a
fire
was
burning
in
one
corner
and
a
heavy
curtain
of
tanned
skins
could
be
draped
over
the
wide
doorway
articles
of
womens
apparel
hung
on
the
walls
and
others
indicating
womans
work
stood
about
there
were
also
chairs
of
wicker
and
a
lounge
covered
with
haircloth
it
was
a
comfortable
place
the
most
attractive
that
robert
had
seen
in
a
long
time
and
his
eyes
responded
to
it
with
a
glitter
that
colonel
johnson
noticed
i
dont
wonder
that
you
like
it
lad
he
said
ive
spent
some
happy
hours
here
myself
when
i
came
in
weary
or
worn
from
hunting
or
fishing
but
sit
you
down
all
three
of
you
ill
warrant
me
that
youre
weary
enough
tramping
through
this
wintry
forest
blunt
shove
the
faggots
closer
together
and
make
up
a
better
fire
the
command
was
to
a
white
servant
who
obeyed
promptly
but
madame
johnson
herself
had
already
shifted
the
chairs
for
the
guests
and
had
taken
their
deerskin
cloaks
without
ceasing
to
be
the
great
lady
she
moved
nevertheless
with
a
lightness
of
foot
and
a
celerity
that
was
all
a
daughter
of
the
forest
robert
watched
her
with
fascinated
eyes
as
she
put
the
summer
house
in
order
and
made
it
ready
for
the
comfort
of
her
guests
here
was
one
who
had
acquired
civilization
without
losing
the
spirit
of
the
wild
she
was
an
educated
and
well
bred
woman
the
wife
of
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
colonies
and
she
was
at
the
same
time
a
true
mohawk
robert
knew
as
he
looked
at
her
that
if
left
alone
in
the
wilderness
she
could
take
care
of
herself
almost
as
well
as
her
cousin
daganoweda
the
young
chief
then
his
gaze
shifted
from
molly
brant
to
her
brother
despite
his
youth
all
his
actions
showed
pride
and
unlimited
confidence
in
himself
he
stood
near
the
door
and
addressed
robert
in
english
asking
him
questions
about
himself
and
he
also
spoke
to
tayoga
showing
him
the
greatest
friendliness
we
be
of
the
mighty
brother
nations
onondaga
and
mohawk
the
first
of
the
great
league
he
said
and
some
day
we
will
sit
together
in
the
councils
of
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
it
is
so
said
tayoga
gravely
speaking
to
the
young
lad
as
man
to
man
we
will
ever
serve
the
hodenosaunee
as
our
fathers
before
us
have
done
leave
the
subject
of
the
hodenosaunee
said
colonel
johnson
cheerily
i
know
that
you
lads
are
prouder
of
your
birth
than
the
old
roman
patricians
ever
were
but
mr
willet
mr
lennox
and
i
were
not
fortunate
enough
to
be
born
into
the
great
league
and
you
will
perhaps
arouse
our
jealousy
or
envy
come
gentlemen
sit
you
down
and
eat
and
drink
his
mohawk
wife
seconded
the
request
and
food
and
drink
were
served
robert
saw
that
the
bower
was
divided
into
two
rooms
the
one
beyond
them
evidently
being
a
sleeping
chamber
but
the
evidences
of
comfort
even
luxury
were
numerous
making
the
place
an
oasis
in
the
wilderness
colonel
johnson
had
wine
which
robert
did
not
touch
nor
did
tayoga
nor
daganoweda
and
there
were
dishes
of
china
or
silver
brought
from
england
he
noticed
also
and
it
was
an
unusual
sight
in
a
lodge
in
the
forest
about
twenty
books
upon
two
shelves
from
his
chair
he
read
the
titles
le
bruns
battles
of
alexander
a
bound
volume
of
the
gentlemans
magazine
roderick
random
and
several
others
colonel
johnsons
eyes
followed
him
i
see
that
you
are
a
reader
he
said
i
know
it
because
your
eyes
linger
upon
my
books
i
have
packages
brought
from
time
to
time
from
england
and
before
i
came
upon
this
expedition
i
had
these
sent
ahead
of
me
to
the
bower
that
i
might
dip
into
them
in
the
evenings
if
i
felt
so
inclined
reading
gives
us
a
wider
horizon
and
at
the
same
time
takes
us
away
from
the
days
troubles
i
agree
with
you
heartily
sir
said
robert
but
unfortunately
we
have
little
time
for
reading
now
that
is
true
sighed
colonel
johnson
i
fear
its
going
to
be
a
long
and
terrible
war
what
do
you
see
joseph
young
brant
was
sitting
with
his
face
to
the
door
and
he
had
risen
suddenly
a
runner
comes
he
replied
he
is
in
the
forest
beyond
the
creek
but
i
see
that
he
is
one
of
our
own
people
he
comes
fast
colonel
johnson
also
arose
can
it
be
some
trouble
among
the
ganeagaono
he
said
i
think
not
said
the
indian
boy
the
runner
emerged
from
the
wood
crossed
the
creek
and
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
bower
he
was
a
tall
thin
young
mohawk
and
he
panted
as
if
he
had
come
fast
and
long
what
is
it
oagowa
asked
colonel
johnson
a
hostile
band
hurons
abenakis
caughnawagas
and
others
has
entered
the
territory
of
the
ganeagaono
on
the
west
replied
the
warrior
they
are
led
by
an
ojibway
chief
a
giant
called
tandakora
robert
uttered
an
exclamation
the
name
of
the
ojibway
attracts
your
attention
said
colonel
johnson
weve
had
many
encounters
with
him
replied
the
youth
besides
hating
the
hodenosaunee
and
all
the
white
people
i
think
he
also
has
a
personal
grievance
against
mr
willet
tayoga
and
myself
he
is
the
most
bitter
and
persistent
of
all
our
enemies
then
this
man
must
be
dealt
with
i
cant
go
against
him
myself
other
affairs
press
too
much
but
i
can
raise
a
force
with
speed
let
me
go
sir
against
tandakora
exclaimed
young
brant
eagerly
and
in
english
colonel
johnson
looked
at
him
a
moment
his
eyes
glistening
and
then
he
laughed
not
with
irony
but
gently
and
with
approval
truly
tis
a
young
eagle
he
said
but
joseph
you
must
remember
that
your
years
are
yet
short
of
twelve
and
you
still
have
much
time
to
spend
over
the
books
in
which
you
have
done
so
well
if
i
let
you
be
cut
off
at
such
an
early
age
you
can
never
become
the
great
chief
you
are
destined
to
be
bide
a
while
joseph
and
your
cousin
daganoweda
will
attend
to
this
ojibway
who
has
wandered
so
far
from
his
own
country
young
brant
made
no
protest
trained
in
the
wonderful
discipline
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
knew
that
he
must
obey
before
he
could
command
he
resumed
his
seat
quietly
but
his
eager
eyes
watched
his
tall
cousin
the
young
mohawk
chieftain
as
colonel
johnson
gave
him
orders
take
with
you
the
warriors
that
you
have
now
daganoweda
he
said
gather
the
fifty
who
are
now
encamped
at
teugega
take
thirty
more
from
talaquega
and
i
think
that
will
be
enough
i
dont
know
you
daganoweda
and
i
dont
know
your
valiant
mohawk
warriors
if
you
are
not
able
to
account
thoroughly
for
the
ojibway
and
his
men
dont
come
back
until
youve
destroyed
them
or
driven
them
out
of
your
country
colonel
johnsons
tone
was
at
once
urgent
and
complimentary
it
intimated
that
the
work
was
important
and
that
daganoweda
would
be
sure
to
do
it
the
mohawks
eyes
glittered
in
his
dark
face
he
lifted
his
hand
in
a
salute
glided
from
the
bower
and
a
moment
later
he
and
his
warriors
passed
from
sight
in
the
forest
that
cousin
of
yours
molly
deserves
his
rank
of
chief
said
colonel
johnson
the
task
that
he
is
to
do
i
consider
as
good
as
done
already
tandakora
was
too
daring
when
he
ventured
into
the
lands
of
the
ganeagaono
now
if
you
gentlemen
will
be
so
good
as
to
be
our
guests
well
pass
the
night
here
and
tomorrow
well
go
to
mount
johnson
it
was
agreeable
to
robert
willet
and
tayoga
and
they
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
most
pleasantly
at
the
bower
colonel
johnson
feeling
that
they
were
three
whom
he
could
trust
talked
freely
and
unveiled
a
mind
fitted
for
great
affairs
i
tell
you
three
he
said
that
this
will
be
one
of
the
most
important
wars
the
world
has
known
to
london
and
paris
we
seem
lost
in
the
woods
out
here
and
perhaps
at
the
courts
they
think
little
of
us
or
they
do
not
think
at
all
but
the
time
must
come
when
the
new
world
will
react
upon
the
old
consider
what
a
country
it
is
with
its
lakes
its
forests
its
rivers
and
its
fertile
lands
which
extend
beyond
the
reckoning
of
man
the
day
will
arrive
when
there
will
be
a
power
here
greater
than
either
england
or
france
such
a
land
cannot
help
but
nourish
it
he
seemed
to
be
much
moved
and
spoke
a
long
time
in
the
same
vein
but
his
indian
wife
never
said
a
word
she
moved
about
now
and
then
and
as
before
her
footsteps
making
no
noise
being
as
light
as
those
of
any
animal
of
the
forest
the
dusk
came
up
to
the
door
they
heard
the
ripple
of
the
creek
but
could
not
see
its
waters
madam
johnson
lighted
a
wax
candle
and
colonel
johnson
stopped
suddenly
i
have
talked
too
much
i
weary
you
he
said
oh
no
sir
protested
robert
eagerly
go
on
we
would
gladly
listen
to
you
all
night
that
i
think
would
be
too
great
a
weight
upon
us
all
laughed
colonel
johnson
you
are
weary
you
must
be
so
from
your
long
marching
and
my
heavy
disquisitions
well
have
beds
made
for
you
three
and
joseph
here
molly
and
i
sleep
in
the
next
room
robert
was
glad
to
have
soft
furs
and
a
floor
beneath
him
and
when
he
lay
down
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
intense
satisfaction
he
liked
colonel
william
johnson
and
knew
that
he
had
a
friend
in
him
he
was
anxious
for
advancement
in
the
great
world
and
he
understood
what
it
was
to
have
powerful
support
already
he
stood
high
with
the
hodenosaunee
and
now
he
had
found
favor
with
the
famous
waraiyageh
they
left
in
the
morning
for
mount
johnson
and
there
were
horses
for
all
except
the
indians
although
one
was
offered
to
tayoga
but
he
declined
to
ridethe
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
were
not
horsemen
and
kept
pace
with
them
at
the
long
easy
gait
used
by
the
indian
runner
robert
himself
was
not
used
to
the
saddle
but
he
was
glad
enough
to
accept
it
after
their
great
march
through
the
wilderness
the
weather
continued
fine
for
winter
crisp
clear
sparkling
with
life
and
the
spirits
of
all
were
high
colonel
johnson
beckoned
to
robert
to
ride
by
the
side
of
him
and
the
two
led
the
way
kegneghtada
despite
his
extreme
youth
had
refused
a
horse
also
and
was
swinging
along
by
the
side
of
tayoga
stride
for
stride
a
perfect
understanding
and
friendship
had
already
been
established
between
the
onondaga
and
the
mohawk
and
as
they
walked
they
talked
together
earnestly
young
brant
bearing
himself
as
if
he
were
on
an
equal
footing
with
his
brother
warrior
tayoga
colonel
johnson
looked
at
them
smiled
approval
and
said
to
robert
i
have
called
my
young
brotherinlaw
an
eagle
and
an
eagle
he
truly
is
were
apt
to
think
mr
lennox
that
we
white
people
alone
gather
our
forces
and
prepare
for
some
aim
distant
but
great
but
the
indian
intellect
is
often
keen
and
powerful
as
i
have
had
good
cause
to
know
many
of
their
chiefs
have
an
acuteness
and
penetration
not
surpassed
in
the
councils
of
white
men
the
great
mohawk
whom
we
call
king
hendrick
probably
has
more
intellect
than
most
of
the
sovereigns
on
their
thrones
in
europe
and
as
for
joseph
the
lad
there
who
so
gallantly
keeps
step
with
the
onondaga
where
will
you
find
a
white
boy
who
can
excel
him
he
absorbs
the
learning
of
our
schools
as
fast
as
any
boy
of
our
race
whom
i
have
ever
known
and
at
the
same
time
he
retains
and
improves
all
the
lore
and
craft
of
the
red
people
you
have
found
the
mohawks
a
brave
and
loyal
race
said
robert
knowing
the
colonel
was
upon
a
favorite
theme
of
his
that
i
have
mr
lennox
i
came
among
them
a
boy
i
was
a
trader
then
and
i
settled
first
only
a
few
miles
from
their
largest
town
dyiondarogon
i
tried
to
keep
faith
with
them
and
as
a
result
i
found
them
always
keeping
faith
with
me
then
when
i
went
to
oghkwaga
i
had
the
same
experience
the
indians
were
defrauded
in
the
fur
trade
by
white
swindlers
but
dishonesty
besides
being
bad
in
itself
does
not
pay
mr
lennox
bear
that
in
mind
you
may
cheat
for
a
while
with
success
but
in
time
nobody
will
do
business
with
you
though
you
i
take
it
will
never
be
a
merchant
it
is
not
because
i
frown
upon
the
merchants
calling
sir
i
esteem
it
a
high
and
noble
one
but
my
mind
does
not
turn
to
it
so
i
gather
from
what
i
have
seen
of
you
and
from
what
mr
willet
tells
me
ive
been
hearing
of
your
gift
of
oratory
you
need
not
blush
my
lad
if
we
have
a
gift
we
should
accept
it
thankfully
and
make
the
best
use
of
it
we
can
you
i
take
it
will
be
a
lawyer
then
a
public
man
and
you
will
sway
the
public
mind
there
should
be
grand
occasions
for
such
as
you
in
a
country
like
this
with
its
unlimited
future
they
came
presently
into
a
region
of
cultivation
fields
which
would
be
green
with
grain
in
the
spring
showing
here
and
there
and
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
of
a
stout
log
house
rising
now
and
then
where
a
creek
broke
into
a
swift
white
fall
stood
a
grist
mill
and
from
a
wood
the
sound
of
axes
was
heard
roberts
vivid
imagination
which
responded
to
all
changes
kindled
at
once
he
liked
the
wilderness
and
it
always
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
and
he
also
took
the
keenest
interest
and
delight
in
everything
that
civilization
could
offer
now
his
spirit
leaped
up
to
meet
what
lay
before
him
he
found
at
mount
johnson
comfort
and
luxury
that
he
had
not
expected
an
abundance
of
all
that
the
wilderness
furnished
mingled
with
importations
from
europe
he
slept
in
a
fine
bed
he
looked
into
more
books
he
saw
on
the
walls
reproductions
of
titian
and
watteau
and
also
pictures
of
race
horses
that
had
made
themselves
famous
at
newmarket
he
wrote
letters
to
albany
on
good
paper
he
could
seal
them
with
either
black
or
red
wax
and
there
were
musical
instruments
upon
one
or
two
of
which
he
could
play
robert
found
all
these
things
congenial
the
luxury
or
what
might
have
seemed
luxury
on
the
border
had
in
it
nothing
of
decadence
there
was
an
air
of
vigor
and
colonel
johnson
although
he
did
not
neglect
his
guests
plunged
at
once
and
deeply
into
business
a
little
village
dependent
upon
him
and
his
affairs
had
grown
up
about
him
and
there
were
white
men
more
or
less
in
his
service
some
of
whom
he
sent
at
once
on
missions
for
the
war
through
it
all
his
indian
wife
glided
quietly
but
robert
saw
that
she
was
a
wonderful
help
managing
with
ease
and
smoothing
away
many
a
difficulty
despite
the
restraint
of
manner
the
people
at
mount
johnson
were
full
of
excitement
the
news
from
canada
and
also
from
the
west
became
steadily
more
ominous
the
french
power
was
growing
fast
and
the
warriors
of
the
wild
tribes
were
crowding
in
thousands
to
the
bourbon
banner
robert
heard
again
of
st
luc
and
of
some
daring
achievement
of
his
and
despite
himself
he
felt
as
always
a
thrill
at
the
name
and
a
runner
also
brought
the
news
that
more
french
troops
had
gone
into
the
ohio
country
the
fourth
night
of
their
stay
at
mount
johnson
robert
remained
awake
late
he
and
young
brant
the
great
thayendanegea
that
was
to
be
had
already
formed
a
great
friendship
the
beginning
of
which
was
made
easier
by
roberts
knowledge
of
indian
nature
and
sympathy
with
it
the
two
wrapped
in
fur
cloaks
had
gone
a
little
distance
from
the
house
because
brant
said
that
a
bear
driven
by
hunger
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
village
and
they
were
looking
for
its
tracks
but
robert
was
more
interested
in
observing
the
indian
boy
than
in
finding
the
foot
prints
of
the
bear
joseph
he
said
you
expect
of
course
to
be
a
great
warrior
and
chief
some
day
the
boys
eyes
glittered
there
is
nothing
else
for
which
i
would
care
he
replied
hark
dagaeoga
did
you
hear
the
cry
of
a
night
bird
i
did
joseph
but
like
you
i
dont
think
its
the
voice
of
a
real
bird
its
a
signal
so
it
is
and
unless
i
reckon
ill
its
the
signal
of
my
cousin
daganoweda
returning
from
the
great
war
trail
that
he
has
trod
against
the
wild
ojibway
tandakora
the
song
of
a
bird
trilled
from
his
own
throat
in
reply
and
then
from
the
forest
came
daganoweda
and
his
warriors
in
a
dusky
file
robert
and
young
brant
fell
in
with
them
and
walked
toward
the
house
not
a
word
was
spoken
but
the
eyes
of
the
mohawk
chieftain
were
gleaming
and
his
bearing
expressed
the
very
concentrated
essence
of
haughty
pride
at
the
house
they
stopped
and
young
brant
going
in
brought
forth
colonel
johnson
well
daganoweda
said
the
white
man
i
met
tandakora
two
days
journey
north
of
mount
johnson
replied
the
mohawk
his
numbers
were
equal
to
our
own
but
his
warriors
were
not
the
warriors
of
the
hodenosaunee
six
of
the
ganeagaono
are
gone
waraiyageh
and
sixteen
more
have
wounds
from
which
they
will
recover
but
when
tandakora
began
his
flight
toward
canada
eighteen
of
his
men
lay
dead
eight
more
fell
in
the
pursuit
which
was
so
fast
that
we
bring
back
with
us
forty
muskets
and
rifles
well
done
daganoweda
said
colonel
johnson
you
have
proved
yourself
anew
a
great
warrior
and
chief
but
you
did
not
have
to
prove
it
to
me
i
knew
it
long
ago
fine
new
rifles
and
blankets
of
blue
or
red
or
green
have
just
come
from
albany
half
of
which
shall
be
distributed
among
your
men
in
the
morning
waraiyageh
never
forgets
his
friends
said
the
appreciative
mohawk
he
withdrew
with
his
warriors
knowing
that
the
promise
would
be
kept
why
was
i
not
allowed
to
go
with
them
mourned
young
brant
colonel
johnson
laughed
and
patted
his
shiny
black
head
never
mind
young
fireeater
he
said
well
all
of
us
soon
have
our
fill
of
warand
more
robert
was
present
at
the
distribution
of
rifles
and
blankets
the
next
morning
and
he
knew
that
colonel
johnson
had
bound
the
mohawks
to
him
and
the
english
and
american
cause
with
another
tie
daganoweda
and
his
warriors
gratified
beyond
expression
took
the
war
path
again
theyll
remain
a
barrier
between
us
and
the
french
and
their
allies
said
colonel
johnson
and
faith
well
need
em
the
other
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
wish
to
keep
out
of
the
war
but
the
mohawks
will
be
with
us
to
the
last
their
great
chief
king
hendrick
is
our
devoted
friend
and
so
is
his
brother
abraham
this
too
in
spite
of
the
bad
treatment
of
the
ganeagaono
by
the
dutch
at
albany
o
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
dutch
a
brave
and
tenacious
people
but
they
have
their
faults
like
other
races
and
sometimes
they
let
avarice
overcome
them
i
wish
they
could
understand
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
better
do
what
you
can
at
albany
mr
lennox
with
that
facile
tongue
of
yours
to
persuade
the
dutchand
the
others
toothat
the
danger
from
the
french
and
indians
is
great
and
that
we
must
keep
the
friendship
of
the
six
nations
i
will
do
my
best
sir
promised
robert
modestly
i
at
least
ought
to
know
the
power
and
loyalty
of
the
hodenosaunee
since
i
have
been
adopted
into
the
great
league
and
tayoga
an
onondaga
is
my
brother
in
all
but
blood
and
i
stand
in
the
same
position
said
willet
firmly
we
understand
sir
your
great
attachment
for
the
six
nations
and
the
vast
service
you
have
done
for
the
english
among
them
if
we
can
supplement
it
even
in
some
small
degree
we
shall
spare
no
effort
to
do
so
i
know
it
mr
willet
and
yet
my
heart
is
heavy
to
see
the
land
i
love
devastated
by
fire
and
sword
colonel
johnson
loaned
them
horses
and
an
escort
of
two
of
his
own
soldiers
who
would
bring
back
the
horses
and
they
started
for
albany
amid
many
hospitable
farewells
you
and
i
shall
meet
again
said
young
brant
to
robert
i
hope
so
said
robert
it
will
be
as
allies
and
comrades
on
the
battle
field
but
you
are
too
young
joseph
yet
to
take
part
in
war
i
shall
not
be
next
year
and
the
war
will
not
be
over
then
so
my
brother
colonel
william
johnson
says
and
he
knows
robert
looked
at
the
sturdy
young
figure
and
the
eager
eyes
and
he
knew
that
the
indian
lad
would
not
be
denied
then
the
little
party
rode
into
the
woods
and
proceeded
without
event
to
albany
chapter
ix
the
watcher
it
was
with
emotion
that
robert
came
to
albany
an
emotion
that
was
shared
by
his
onondaga
comrade
tayoga
who
had
spent
a
long
time
in
a
white
school
there
the
staid
dutch
town
was
the
great
outpost
of
the
province
of
new
york
in
the
wilderness
and
although
his
temperament
was
unlike
that
of
the
dutch
burghers
he
had
innumerable
pleasant
memories
of
it
and
many
friends
there
it
was
in
his
esteem
too
a
fine
town
on
its
hills
overlooking
that
noble
river
the
hudson
and
as
the
little
group
rode
on
he
noted
that
despite
the
war
its
appearance
was
still
peaceful
and
safe
their
way
led
along
the
main
street
which
was
broad
and
with
grass
on
either
side
the
solid
dutch
houses
with
their
gable
ends
to
the
street
stood
every
one
on
its
own
lawn
with
a
garden
behind
it
every
house
also
had
a
portico
in
front
of
it
on
which
the
people
sat
in
summer
evenings
or
where
they
visited
with
one
another
except
that
it
was
hills
where
the
old
country
was
flat
it
was
much
like
holland
and
the
people
keen
and
thrifty
had
preserved
their
national
customs
even
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generations
robert
understood
them
as
he
understood
the
hodenosaunce
and
with
his
adaptable
temperament
and
with
his
mind
that
could
understand
so
readily
the
minds
of
others
he
was
able
to
meet
them
on
common
ground
as
they
rode
into
the
city
he
looked
questioningly
at
willet
and
the
hunter
understanding
the
voiceless
query
smiled
we
couldnt
think
of
going
to
any
other
place
he
said
if
we
did
we
could
never
secure
his
forgiveness
i
shall
be
more
than
glad
to
see
him
a
right
good
friend
of
ours
isnt
he
tayoga
though
his
tongue
lashes
us
his
heart
is
with
us
replied
the
onondaga
he
is
a
great
white
chief
three
hundred
pounds
of
greatness
they
stopped
before
one
of
the
largest
of
the
brick
houses
standing
on
one
of
the
widest
and
neatest
of
the
lawns
and
robert
and
tayoga
entering
the
portico
knocked
upon
the
door
with
a
heavy
brass
knocker
they
heard
presently
the
rattle
of
chains
inside
and
the
rumble
of
a
deep
grumbling
voice
then
the
two
lads
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
laughed
in
the
careless
joyous
way
in
which
youth
alone
can
laugh
it
is
he
mynheer
jacobus
himself
come
to
let
us
in
said
robert
and
he
has
not
changed
at
all
said
tayoga
we
can
tell
that
by
the
character
of
his
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
i
would
not
have
him
changed
nor
would
i
the
door
was
thrown
open
but
as
all
the
windows
were
closed
there
was
yet
gloom
inside
presently
something
large
red
and
shining
emerged
from
the
dusk
and
two
beams
of
light
in
the
center
of
the
redness
played
upon
them
then
the
outlines
of
a
gigantic
human
figure
a
man
tall
and
immensely
stout
were
disclosed
he
wore
a
black
suit
with
knee
breeches
thick
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
and
his
powdered
hair
was
tied
in
a
queue
his
eyes
dazzled
at
first
by
the
light
from
without
began
to
twinkle
as
he
looked
then
a
great
blaze
of
joy
swept
over
his
face
and
he
held
out
two
fat
hands
one
to
the
white
youth
and
one
to
the
red
ah
it
iss
you
robert
you
scapegrace
and
it
iss
you
tayoga
you
wild
onondaga
it
iss
a
glad
day
for
me
that
you
haf
come
but
i
thought
you
both
dead
und
well
you
might
be
reckless
thoughtless
lads
who
haf
not
the
thought
uf
the
future
in
your
minds
robert
shook
the
fat
hand
in
both
of
his
and
laughed
you
are
the
same
as
of
old
mynheer
jacobus
he
said
and
before
tayoga
and
i
saw
you
but
while
we
heard
you
we
agreed
that
there
had
been
no
change
and
that
we
did
not
want
any
and
why
should
i
change
you
two
young
rascals
am
i
not
goot
enough
as
i
am
haf
i
not
in
the
past
given
the
punishment
to
both
uf
you
und
am
i
not
able
to
do
it
again
tall
and
strong
as
the
two
uf
you
haf
grown
ah
such
foolish
lads
perhaps
you
haf
been
spared
because
pity
wass
taken
on
your
foolishness
but
iss
it
mynheer
willet
beyond
you
that
iss
a
man
of
sense
its
none
other
than
dave
mynheer
jacobus
said
robert
then
why
doesnt
he
come
in
exclaimed
mynheer
jacobus
huysman
he
iss
welcome
here
doubly
triply
welcome
und
he
knows
it
dave
dave
hurry
called
robert
or
mynheer
jacobus
will
chastise
you
hes
so
anxious
to
fall
on
your
neck
and
welcome
you
that
he
cant
wait
willet
came
swiftly
up
the
brick
walk
and
the
hands
of
the
two
big
men
met
in
a
warm
clasp
you
see
ive
brought
the
boys
back
to
you
again
jacob
said
the
hunter
but
what
reckless
lads
theyve
become
grumbled
mynheer
huysman
i
can
see
the
mischief
in
their
eyes
now
they
wass
bad
enough
when
they
went
to
school
here
und
lived
with
me
but
since
theyve
run
wild
in
the
forests
this
house
iss
not
able
to
hold
them
dont
you
worry
jacob
old
friend
these
arms
and
shoulders
of
mine
are
still
strong
and
if
they
make
you
trouble
i
will
deal
with
them
but
we
just
stopped
a
minute
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
your
health
can
you
tell
us
which
is
now
the
best
inn
in
albany
the
face
of
mynheer
jacobus
huysman
flamed
and
his
eyes
blazed
in
the
center
of
it
two
great
red
lights
inn
inn
he
roared
in
his
queer
mixture
of
english
dutch
and
german
accent
iss
it
that
your
head
hass
been
struck
by
lightning
und
you
haf
gone
crazy
if
there
wass
a
thousand
inns
at
albany
you
und
robert
und
tayoga
could
not
stop
at
one
uf
them
iss
not
the
house
uf
jacobus
huysman
good
enough
for
you
robert
tayoga
and
the
hunter
laughed
aloud
he
did
but
make
game
of
you
mynheer
jacobus
said
robert
we
will
alter
your
statement
and
say
if
there
were
a
thousand
inns
in
albany
you
could
not
make
us
stay
at
any
one
of
them
despite
your
commands
we
would
come
directly
to
your
house
mynheer
jacobus
huysman
permitted
himself
to
smile
but
his
voice
renewed
its
grumbling
tone
ever
the
same
he
said
you
must
stay
here
although
only
the
good
lord
himself
knows
in
what
condition
my
house
will
be
when
you
leave
you
are
two
wild
lads
it
iss
not
so
strange
uf
you
robert
lennox
who
are
white
but
i
would
expect
better
uf
tayoga
who
is
to
be
a
great
onondaga
chief
some
day
you
make
a
great
mistake
mynheer
jacobus
said
robert
tayoga
is
far
worse
than
i
am
all
the
mischief
that
i
have
ever
done
was
due
to
his
example
and
persuasion
it
is
my
misfortune
that
i
have
a
weak
nature
and
i
am
easily
led
into
evil
by
my
associates
it
iss
not
so
you
are
equally
bad
bring
in
your
baggage
und
i
will
see
if
caterina
der
cook
cannot
find
enough
for
you
three
who
always
eat
like
raging
lions
the
soldiers
who
were
to
return
immediately
to
colonel
william
johnson
rode
away
with
their
horses
and
robert
tayoga
and
willet
took
their
packs
into
the
house
of
mynheer
huysman
who
grumbled
incessantly
while
he
and
a
manservant
and
a
maidservant
made
them
as
comfortable
as
possible
would
you
und
tayoga
like
to
haf
your
old
room
on
the
second
floor
he
said
to
robert
nothing
would
please
us
better
replied
the
lad
then
you
shall
haf
it
said
mynheer
as
he
led
the
way
up
the
stair
and
into
the
room
do
you
remember
tayoga
how
wild
you
wass
when
you
came
here
to
learn
the
good
ways
und
bad
ways
uf
the
white
people
i
do
replied
tayoga
and
the
walls
and
the
roof
felt
oppressive
to
me
although
we
have
stout
log
houses
of
our
own
in
our
villages
but
they
were
not
our
own
walls
and
our
own
roof
and
there
was
the
great
young
warrior
lennox
whom
we
now
call
dagaeoga
who
was
to
stay
in
the
same
room
and
even
in
the
same
bed
with
me
do
you
wonder
that
i
felt
like
climbing
out
of
a
window
at
night
and
escaping
into
the
woods
you
were
eleven
then
said
robert
and
i
was
just
a
shade
younger
you
were
as
strange
to
me
as
i
was
to
you
and
i
thought
in
truth
that
you
were
going
to
run
away
into
the
wilderness
but
you
didnt
and
you
began
to
learn
from
books
faster
than
i
thought
was
possible
for
one
whose
mind
before
then
had
been
turned
in
another
direction
but
you
helped
me
dagaeoga
after
our
first
and
only
battle
in
the
garden
which
i
think
was
a
draw
we
became
allies
und
you
united
against
me
said
mynheer
huysman
and
you
helped
me
with
the
books
continued
tayoga
ah
those
first
months
were
hard
very
hard
and
you
taught
me
the
use
of
the
bow
and
arrow
continued
robert
and
new
skill
in
both
fishing
and
hunting
und
the
two
uf
you
together
learned
new
tricks
und
new
ways
uf
making
my
life
miserable
grumbled
mynheer
huysman
but
you
must
admit
jacob
said
willet
that
they
were
not
the
worst
boys
in
the
world
well
not
the
worst
perhaps
david
because
i
dont
know
all
the
boys
uf
all
the
countries
in
the
world
but
when
you
put
an
onondaga
lad
und
an
american
lad
together
in
alliance
it
iss
hard
to
find
any
one
who
can
excel
them
because
they
haf
the
mischief
uf
two
nations
but
you
are
tremendously
glad
to
see
them
again
jacob
dont
deny
it
i
read
it
over
and
over
again
in
your
eyes
willets
own
eyes
twinkled
as
he
spoke
and
he
saw
also
that
there
was
a
light
in
those
of
the
big
dutchman
but
huysman
would
admit
nothing
here
iss
your
room
he
said
to
robert
and
tayoga
robert
saw
that
it
was
not
changed
all
the
old
familiar
objects
were
there
and
they
brought
to
him
a
rush
of
emotion
as
inanimate
things
often
do
on
a
heavy
mahogany
dresser
lay
two
worn
volumes
that
he
touched
affectionately
one
was
his
caesar
and
the
other
his
algebra
once
he
had
hated
both
but
now
he
thought
of
them
tenderly
as
links
with
the
peaceful
boyhood
that
was
slipping
away
hanging
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
was
an
unstrung
bow
the
first
weapon
of
the
kind
with
which
he
had
practiced
under
the
teaching
of
tayoga
he
passed
his
hand
over
it
gently
and
felt
a
thrill
at
the
touch
of
the
wood
tayoga
also
was
moving
about
the
room
on
a
small
shelf
lay
an
english
dictionary
and
several
readers
they
too
were
worn
he
had
spent
many
a
grieving
hour
over
them
when
he
had
come
from
the
iroquois
forests
to
learn
the
white
mans
lore
he
recalled
how
he
had
hated
them
for
a
time
and
how
he
had
looked
out
of
his
school
windows
at
the
freedom
for
which
he
had
longed
but
he
was
made
of
wrought
steel
both
mind
and
body
and
always
the
white
youth
lennox
his
comrade
was
at
his
elbow
in
those
days
of
his
scholastic
infancy
to
help
him
it
had
been
a
great
episode
in
the
life
of
tayoga
who
had
the
intellect
of
a
mighty
chief
the
mind
of
pontiac
or
thayendanegea
or
tecumseh
or
sequoia
he
had
forced
himself
to
learn
and
in
learning
his
books
he
had
learned
also
to
like
the
people
of
another
race
around
him
who
were
good
to
him
and
who
helped
him
in
the
first
hard
days
on
the
new
road
so
the
young
onondaga
felt
an
emotion
much
like
that
of
robert
as
he
walked
about
the
room
and
touched
the
old
familiar
things
then
he
turned
to
huysman
mynheer
jacobus
he
said
you
have
a
mighty
body
and
you
have
in
it
a
great
heart
if
all
the
men
at
albany
were
like
you
there
would
never
be
any
trouble
between
them
and
the
hodenosaunee
tayoga
said
huysman
you
haf
borrowed
roberts
tongue
to
cozen
und
flatter
i
haf
not
a
great
heart
at
all
i
haf
a
very
bad
heart
i
could
not
get
on
in
this
world
if
i
didnt
tayoga
laughed
musically
and
mynheer
jacobus
gruffly
bidding
them
not
to
destroy
anything
while
he
was
gone
departed
to
see
that
caterina
the
dutch
cook
fat
like
her
master
should
have
ready
a
dinner
drawing
upon
every
resource
of
his
ample
larder
it
is
but
truth
to
say
that
the
heart
of
mynheer
jacobus
was
very
full
a
fat
old
bachelor
with
no
near
kin
his
heart
yearned
over
the
two
lads
who
had
spent
so
long
a
period
in
his
home
and
he
knew
them
too
for
what
they
were
each
a
fine
flower
of
his
own
racial
stock
they
were
to
remain
several
days
in
albany
and
after
dinner
they
visited
alexander
mclean
the
crusty
teacher
who
had
given
them
such
a
severe
drilling
in
their
books
master
mclean
allowed
himself
a
few
brief
expressions
of
pleasure
when
they
came
into
his
house
and
then
questioned
them
sharply
do
you
remember
any
of
your
ancient
history
tayoga
he
asked
are
the
great
deeds
of
the
greeks
and
romans
still
in
your
mind
at
times
they
are
sir
replied
the
young
onondaga
umm
is
that
so
what
was
the
date
of
the
battle
of
zama
it
was
fought
202
bc
sir
youre
correct
but
it
must
have
been
only
a
lucky
guess
ill
try
you
again
what
was
the
date
of
the
battle
of
hastings
it
was
fought
1066
ad
sir
very
good
since
you
have
answered
correctly
twice
it
must
be
knowledge
and
not
mere
surmise
on
your
part
robert
whom
do
you
esteem
the
greatest
of
the
greek
dramatic
poets
sophocles
sir
why
because
he
combined
the
vigor
and
power
of
aeschylus
with
the
polish
and
refinement
of
euripides
correct
i
see
that
you
remember
what
i
told
you
as
you
have
quoted
almost
my
exact
words
and
now
lads
be
seated
while
i
order
refreshments
for
you
we
thank
you
sir
said
robert
but
tis
less
than
an
hour
since
we
almost
ate
ourselves
to
death
at
the
house
of
mynheer
jacobus
huysman
a
good
man
jacob
but
too
fat
and
far
too
brusque
in
speech
especially
to
the
young
ill
warrant
me
he
has
been
addressing
upbraiding
words
to
you
finding
fault
perhaps
with
your
manners
and
your
parts
of
speech
the
two
youths
hid
their
smiles
mynheer
jacobus
was
very
good
to
us
said
robert
just
as
you
are
master
mclean
i
am
not
good
to
you
if
you
mean
by
it
weakness
and
softness
of
heart
never
spoil
the
young
speak
sternly
to
them
all
the
time
use
the
strap
and
the
rod
freely
upon
them
and
you
may
make
men
of
them
again
robert
and
tayoga
hid
their
smiles
but
each
knew
that
he
had
a
soft
place
in
the
heart
of
the
crusty
teacher
and
they
spent
a
pleasant
hour
with
him
that
night
they
slept
in
their
old
room
at
mynheer
huysmans
and
two
days
later
they
and
willet
went
on
board
a
sloop
for
new
york
where
they
intended
to
see
governor
de
lancey
before
they
left
many
more
alarming
reports
about
the
french
and
indians
had
come
to
albany
they
had
made
new
ravages
in
the
north
and
west
and
their
power
was
spreading
continually
france
was
already
helping
her
colonists
when
would
england
help
hers
but
robert
forgot
all
alarm
in
the
pleasure
of
the
voyage
it
was
a
good
sloop
it
had
a
stout
dutch
captain
and
with
a
favoring
wind
they
sped
fast
southward
pride
in
the
splendid
river
swelled
in
roberts
soul
and
he
and
tayoga
despite
the
cold
sat
together
on
the
deck
watching
the
lofty
shores
and
the
distant
mountains
but
willet
anxious
of
mind
paced
back
and
forth
he
had
seen
much
at
albany
that
did
not
please
him
the
indian
commissioners
were
doing
little
to
cement
the
alliance
with
the
hodenosaunee
the
mohawks
alone
of
the
great
league
were
giving
aid
against
the
french
the
others
remained
in
their
villages
keeping
a
strict
neutrality
that
was
well
as
far
as
it
went
but
the
hunter
had
hoped
that
all
the
members
of
the
hodenosaunee
would
take
the
field
for
the
english
he
believed
that
father
drouillard
would
soon
be
back
among
the
onondagas
seeking
to
sway
his
converts
to
france
and
he
dreaded
too
the
activity
and
persistency
of
st
luc
but
he
kept
his
anxieties
from
robert
knowing
how
eagerly
the
lad
anticipated
his
arrival
in
new
york
and
not
blaming
him
at
all
for
it
since
new
york
although
inferior
in
wealth
size
and
power
to
philadelphia
and
in
leadership
to
boston
was
already
in
the
eye
of
the
prophets
because
of
its
situation
destined
to
become
the
first
city
of
america
and
willet
felt
his
own
pulses
beat
a
little
faster
at
the
thought
of
new
york
a
town
that
he
knew
well
and
already
a
port
famous
throughout
the
world
tayoga
although
he
wore
his
indian
dress
attracted
no
particular
attention
from
captain
van
zouten
and
his
crew
indians
could
be
seen
daily
at
albany
and
along
the
river
and
they
had
been
for
generations
a
part
of
american
life
captain
van
zouten
in
truth
noticed
the
height
and
fine
bearing
of
the
onondaga
but
he
was
a
close
mouthed
dutchman
and
if
he
felt
like
asking
questions
he
put
due
dutch
restraint
upon
himself
the
wind
held
good
all
day
long
and
the
sloop
flew
southward
leaving
a
long
white
trail
in
the
blue
water
but
toward
night
it
rose
to
a
gale
with
heavy
clouds
that
promised
snow
captain
hendrick
van
zouten
looked
up
with
some
anxiety
at
his
sails
through
which
the
wind
was
now
whistling
and
after
a
consultation
with
his
mate
decided
to
draw
into
a
convenient
cove
and
anchor
for
the
night
im
sorry
he
said
to
willet
that
our
voyage
to
new
york
will
be
delayed
but
therell
be
nasty
weather
on
the
river
and
i
dont
like
to
risk
the
sloop
in
it
but
i
didnt
promise
you
that
id
get
you
to
the
city
at
any
particular
time
we
dont
blame
wind
weather
and
water
upon
you
captain
van
zouten
laughed
willet
and
although
im
no
seaman
if
youd
have
consulted
me
i
too
would
have
suggested
shelter
for
the
night
captain
van
zouten
breathed
his
relief
if
my
passengers
are
satisfied
he
said
then
so
am
i
all
the
sails
were
furled
the
sloop
was
anchored
securely
in
a
cove
where
she
could
not
injure
herself
no
matter
how
fiercely
the
wind
might
beat
and
robert
and
tayoga
wrapped
in
their
fur
cloaks
stood
on
her
deck
watching
the
advance
of
the
fierce
winter
storm
and
remembering
those
other
storms
they
had
passed
through
on
lake
champlain
although
there
was
no
danger
of
indians
here
it
began
to
snow
heavily
and
a
fierce
wind
whistled
among
the
mountains
behind
them
lashing
the
river
also
into
high
waves
but
the
sloop
was
a
tight
strong
craft
and
it
rocked
but
little
in
its
snug
cove
despite
snow
wind
and
darkness
robert
tayoga
and
the
hunter
remained
a
long
time
on
deck
the
onondagas
feather
headdress
had
been
replaced
by
a
fur
cap
similar
to
those
now
worn
by
robert
and
willet
and
all
three
were
wrapped
in
heavy
cloaks
of
furs
robert
was
still
thinking
of
new
york
a
town
that
he
knew
to
some
extent
and
yet
he
was
traveling
toward
it
with
a
feeling
akin
to
that
with
which
he
had
approached
quebec
it
was
in
a
way
and
for
its
time
a
great
port
in
which
many
languages
were
spoken
and
to
which
many
ships
came
despite
its
inferiority
in
size
it
was
already
the
chief
window
through
which
the
new
world
looked
upon
the
old
he
expected
to
see
life
in
the
seething
little
city
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
and
he
expected
also
that
a
crisis
in
his
fortunes
would
come
there
dave
he
said
to
the
hunter
have
you
any
plans
for
us
in
new
york
theyve
not
taken
very
definite
shape
replied
willet
but
you
know
you
want
to
serve
in
the
war
and
so
do
i
a
great
expedition
is
coming
out
from
england
and
in
conjunction
with
a
colonial
force
it
will
march
against
fort
duquesne
the
point
to
which
that
force
advances
is
bound
to
be
the
chief
scene
of
action
and
that
dave
is
where
we
want
to
go
with
proper
commissions
in
the
army
we
must
maintain
our
dignity
and
station
robert
of
course
dave
and
you
tayoga
are
you
willing
to
go
with
us
it
is
far
from
the
vale
of
onondaga
replied
the
young
indian
but
i
have
already
made
the
great
journey
to
quebec
with
my
comrades
dagaeoga
and
the
great
bear
i
am
willing
to
see
more
of
the
world
of
which
i
read
in
the
books
at
albany
if
the
fortunes
of
dagaeoga
take
him
on
another
long
circle
i
am
ready
to
go
with
him
spoken
like
a
warrior
tayoga
said
the
hunter
i
have
some
influence
and
if
we
join
the
army
that
is
to
march
against
fort
duquesne
ill
see
that
you
receive
a
place
befitting
your
onondaga
rank
and
your
quality
as
a
man
and
so
that
is
settled
said
robert
we
three
stand
together
no
matter
what
may
come
stand
together
it
is
no
matter
what
may
come
said
willet
we
are
perhaps
as
well
in
one
place
as
in
another
said
tayoga
philosophically
because
wherever
we
may
be
manitou
holds
us
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
a
great
gust
of
wind
came
with
a
shriek
down
one
of
the
gorges
and
the
snow
was
whipped
into
their
faces
blinding
them
for
a
moment
it
is
good
to
be
aboard
a
stout
sloop
in
such
a
storm
said
robert
as
he
wiped
his
eyes
clear
it
would
be
hard
to
live
up
there
on
those
cliffs
in
all
this
driving
white
winter
a
deep
rumbling
sound
came
back
from
the
mountains
and
he
felt
a
chill
that
was
not
of
the
cold
creep
into
his
bones
it
is
the
wind
in
the
deep
gorges
said
tayoga
but
the
winds
themselves
are
spirits
and
the
mountains
too
are
spirits
on
such
a
wild
night
as
this
they
play
together
and
the
rumbling
you
hear
is
their
voices
joined
in
laughter
roberts
vivid
mind
as
usual
responded
at
once
to
tayogas
imagery
and
his
fancy
went
as
far
as
that
of
the
onondaga
and
perhaps
farther
he
filled
the
air
with
spirits
they
lined
the
edge
of
the
driving
white
storm
they
flitted
through
every
cleft
and
gorge
and
above
every
ridge
and
peak
they
were
on
the
river
and
they
rode
upon
the
waves
that
were
pursuing
one
another
over
its
surface
then
he
laughed
a
little
at
himself
my
fancy
is
seeing
innumerable
figures
for
me
he
said
where
my
eyes
really
see
none
no
human
being
is
likely
to
be
abroad
on
the
river
on
such
a
night
as
this
and
yet
my
own
eyes
tell
me
that
i
do
see
a
human
being
said
tayoga
one
that
is
living
and
breathing
with
warm
blood
running
in
his
veins
a
living
breathing
man
where
tayoga
look
at
the
sloping
cliff
above
us
there
where
the
trees
grow
close
together
notice
the
one
with
the
boughs
hanging
low
and
by
the
dark
trunk
you
will
see
the
figure
it
is
a
tall
man
with
his
hat
drawn
low
over
his
eyes
and
a
heavy
cloak
wrapped
closely
around
his
body
i
see
him
now
tayoga
what
could
a
man
want
at
such
a
place
on
such
a
night
it
must
be
a
farmer
out
late
or
perhaps
a
wandering
hunter
nay
dagaeoga
it
is
not
a
farmer
nor
yet
a
wandering
hunter
the
shoulders
are
set
too
squarely
the
figure
is
too
upright
and
even
without
these
differences
we
would
be
sure
that
it
is
not
the
farmer
nor
yet
the
wandering
hunter
because
it
is
some
one
else
whom
we
know
what
do
you
mean
tayoga
look
look
closely
dagaeoga
now
the
wind
drives
aside
the
white
veil
of
snow
and
i
see
him
better
his
figure
is
surely
familiar
aye
dagaeoga
it
is
and
do
you
not
know
him
st
luc
as
sure
as
we
live
tayoga
its
st
luc
yes
said
the
hunter
who
had
not
spoken
hitherto
its
st
luc
and
i
could
reach
him
from
here
with
a
rifle
shot
but
you
must
not
you
must
not
fire
upon
him
exclaimed
robert
willet
laughed
i
wasnt
thinking
of
doing
so
he
said
and
now
its
too
late
st
luc
has
gone
the
dark
figure
vanished
from
beside
the
trunk
and
robert
saw
only
the
lofty
slope
and
the
whirling
snow
he
passed
his
hands
before
his
eyes
did
we
really
see
him
he
said
we
beheld
him
alive
and
in
the
flesh
replied
the
hunter
deep
down
in
his
britannic
majestys
province
of
new
york
what
could
have
brought
him
here
at
such
a
time
the
cause
of
france
no
doubt
he
speaks
english
as
well
as
you
and
i
and
he
is
probably
in
civilian
clothing
seeking
information
for
his
country
i
know
something
of
st
luc
he
has
in
him
a
spice
of
the
daring
and
romantic
luck
and
adventure
would
appeal
to
him
he
probably
knows
already
what
forces
we
have
at
albany
and
kingston
and
what
is
their
state
of
preparation
valuable
knowledge
for
quebec
too
do
you
think
st
luc
will
venture
to
new
york
scarce
likely
lad
he
can
obtain
about
all
he
wishes
to
know
without
going
so
far
south
im
glad
of
that
dave
i
shouldnt
want
him
to
be
captured
and
hanged
as
a
spy
nor
i
robert
st
luc
is
the
kind
of
man
who
if
he
falls
at
all
in
this
war
should
fall
sword
in
hand
on
the
battle
field
he
must
know
this
region
or
he
would
not
dare
to
come
here
on
such
a
terrible
night
he
has
probably
gone
now
to
shelter
and
since
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
seen
we
might
do
the
same
but
robert
and
tayoga
were
not
willing
to
withdraw
yet
well
wrapped
and
warm
they
found
a
pleasure
in
the
fierce
storm
that
raged
among
the
mountains
and
over
the
river
and
their
own
security
on
the
deck
of
the
stout
sloop
fastened
so
safely
in
the
little
cove
they
listened
to
the
wind
rumbling
anew
like
thunder
through
the
deep
gorges
and
clefts
and
they
saw
the
snow
swept
in
vast
curtains
of
white
over
the
wild
river
i
wonder
what
we
shall
find
in
new
york
tayoga
said
robert
we
shall
find
many
people
of
many
kinds
dagaeoga
but
what
will
happen
to
us
there
manitou
alone
knows
but
he
has
us
in
his
keeping
look
how
he
watched
over
us
in
quebec
and
look
how
the
sword
of
the
great
bear
was
stretched
before
you
when
your
enemies
planned
to
slay
you
thats
true
tayoga
i
dont
look
forward
to
new
york
with
any
apprehension
but
i
do
wonder
what
fate
has
prepared
for
us
there
we
must
await
it
with
calm
said
tayoga
philosophically
the
onondaga
himself
was
not
a
stranger
to
new
york
he
had
gone
there
once
with
the
chiefs
of
the
hodenosaunee
for
a
grand
council
with
the
british
and
provincial
authorities
and
he
had
gone
twice
with
robert
when
they
were
schoolboys
together
in
albany
his
enlightened
mind
without
losing
any
of
its
dignity
and
calm
took
a
deep
interest
in
everything
he
saw
at
the
port
through
which
the
tide
of
nations
already
flowed
he
had
much
of
the
quality
shown
later
by
the
fiery
thayendanegea
who
bore
himself
with
the
best
in
london
and
who
was
their
equal
in
manners
though
the
onondaga
while
as
brave
and
daring
as
the
mohawk
was
gentler
and
more
spiritual
being
in
truth
what
his
mind
and
circumstances
had
made
him
a
singular
blend
of
red
and
white
culture
willet
also
wrapped
in
a
long
fur
cloak
came
from
the
cabin
of
the
sloop
and
looked
at
the
two
youths
each
of
whom
had
such
a
great
place
in
his
heart
both
were
white
with
snow
as
they
stood
on
the
deck
but
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
come
now
said
the
hunter
with
assumed
brusqueness
you
neednt
stand
here
all
night
looking
at
the
river
the
cliffs
and
the
storm
off
to
your
berths
both
of
you
good
advice
or
rather
command
dave
said
robert
and
well
obey
it
their
quarters
were
narrow
because
sloops
plying
on
the
river
in
those
days
were
not
large
but
the
three
who
slept
so
often
in
the
forest
were
not
seekers
after
luxury
robert
undressed
crept
into
his
bunk
which
was
not
over
two
feet
wide
and
slept
soundly
until
morning
after
midnight
the
violence
of
the
storm
abated
it
was
still
snowing
but
captain
van
zouten
unfurled
his
sails
made
for
the
middle
of
the
river
and
when
the
sun
came
up
over
the
eastern
hills
the
sloop
was
tearing
along
at
a
great
rate
for
new
york
so
when
robert
awoke
and
heard
the
groaning
of
timbers
and
the
creak
of
cordage
he
knew
at
once
that
they
were
under
way
and
he
was
glad
the
events
of
the
night
before
passed
rapidly
through
his
mind
but
they
seemed
vague
and
indistinct
at
first
he
thought
the
vision
of
st
luc
on
the
cliff
in
the
storm
was
but
a
dream
and
he
had
to
make
an
effort
of
the
will
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
reality
but
everything
came
back
presently
as
vivid
as
it
had
been
when
it
occurred
and
rising
he
dressed
and
went
on
deck
tayoga
and
willet
were
already
there
sluggard
said
the
onondaga
the
french
warships
would
capture
you
while
you
are
still
in
the
land
of
dreams
well
find
no
french
warships
in
the
hudson
retorted
robert
and
as
for
sluggards
how
long
have
you
been
on
deck
yourself
tayoga
two
minutes
but
much
may
happen
in
two
minutes
look
dagaeoga
we
come
now
into
a
land
of
plenty
see
how
many
smokes
rise
on
either
shore
and
the
smoke
is
not
of
camps
but
of
houses
it
comes
from
strong
dutch
farmhouses
and
from
english
manor
houses
tayoga
they
nestle
in
the
warm
shelter
of
the
hills
or
at
the
mouths
of
the
creeks
surely
the
world
cannot
furnish
a
nobler
scene
all
the
earth
was
pure
white
from
the
fallen
snow
but
the
river
itself
was
a
deep
blue
reflected
from
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
overhead
the
air
thin
and
cold
was
exhilarating
and
as
the
sloop
fled
southward
a
panorama
increasing
continually
in
magnificence
unfolded
before
them
other
vessels
appeared
upon
the
river
and
captain
van
zouten
gave
them
friendly
signals
tiny
villages
showed
and
the
shores
were
an
obvious
manifestation
of
comfort
and
opulence
i
have
heard
that
the
french
if
their
success
continues
mean
to
attack
albany
said
robert
but
we
must
stop
them
there
dave
we
can
never
let
them
invade
such
a
region
as
this
theyll
invade
it
nevertheless
said
the
hunter
unless
stout
arms
and
brave
hearts
stop
them
we
can
drive
both
french
and
indians
back
if
we
ever
unite
there
lies
the
trouble
we
must
get
some
sort
of
concentrated
action
and
new
york
is
the
best
place
to
see
whether
it
will
be
done
or
not
so
it
is
the
wind
remained
favorable
all
that
day
the
next
night
there
was
a
calm
but
the
following
day
they
drew
near
to
new
york
captain
van
zouten
assuring
them
he
would
make
a
landing
before
sunset
he
was
well
ahead
of
his
promise
because
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
when
the
sloop
began
to
pass
the
high
wooded
hills
that
lie
at
the
upper
end
of
manhattan
island
and
they
drew
in
to
their
anchorage
near
the
battery
they
did
not
see
the
stone
government
buildings
that
had
marked
quebec
nor
the
numerous
signs
of
a
fortress
city
but
they
beheld
more
ships
and
more
indications
of
a
great
industrial
life
every
time
i
come
here
said
willet
it
seems
to
me
that
the
masts
increase
in
number
truly
it
is
a
good
town
and
an
abundant
life
flows
through
it
where
shall
we
stop
dave
asked
robert
do
you
have
a
tavern
in
mind
not
a
tavern
replied
the
hunter
my
minds
on
a
private
house
belonging
to
a
friend
of
mine
you
have
not
met
him
because
he
is
at
sea
or
in
foreign
parts
most
of
the
time
yet
we
are
assured
of
a
welcome
an
hour
later
they
said
farewell
to
captain
van
zouten
carried
their
own
light
baggage
and
entered
the
streets
of
the
port
chapter
x
the
port
the
three
walked
toward
the
battery
and
while
tayoga
attracted
more
attention
in
new
york
than
in
quebec
it
was
not
undue
the
city
was
used
to
indians
especially
the
iroquois
and
although
comments
were
made
upon
tayogas
height
and
noble
appearance
there
was
nothing
annoying
meanwhile
the
two
youths
were
using
their
excellent
eyes
to
the
full
although
the
vivid
imagination
of
robert
had
foreseen
a
great
future
for
new
york
he
did
not
dream
how
vast
it
would
be
yet
all
things
are
relative
and
the
city
even
then
looked
large
to
him
and
full
of
life
both
size
and
activity
having
increased
visibly
since
his
last
visit
some
of
the
streets
were
paved
or
at
least
in
part
and
the
houses
usually
of
red
brick
often
several
stories
in
height
were
comfortable
and
strong
many
of
them
had
lawns
and
gardens
as
at
albany
and
the
best
were
planted
with
rows
of
trees
which
would
afford
a
fine
shade
in
warm
weather
above
the
mercantile
houses
and
dwellings
rose
the
lofty
spire
of
st
georges
chapel
in
nassau
street
which
had
been
completed
less
than
three
years
before
and
which
secured
roberts
admiration
for
its
height
and
impressiveness
the
aspect
of
the
whole
town
was
a
mixture
of
english
and
dutch
but
they
saw
many
sailors
who
were
of
neither
race
some
were
brown
men
with
rings
in
their
ears
and
they
spoke
languages
that
robert
did
not
understand
but
he
knew
that
they
came
from
far
southern
seas
and
that
they
sailed
among
the
tropic
isles
looming
large
then
in
the
worlds
fancy
bringing
with
them
a
whiff
of
romance
and
mystery
the
sidewalks
in
many
places
were
covered
with
boxes
and
bales
brought
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
and
stalwart
men
were
at
work
among
them
the
pulsing
life
and
the
air
of
prosperity
pleased
robert
his
nature
responded
to
the
town
as
it
had
responded
to
the
woods
and
his
imagination
leaping
ahead
saw
a
city
many
times
greater
than
the
one
before
his
eyes
though
it
still
stopped
far
short
of
the
gigantic
reality
that
was
to
come
to
pass
its
not
far
now
to
master
hardys
said
willet
cheerfully
its
many
a
day
since
ive
seen
trusty
old
ben
and
right
glad
ill
be
to
feel
the
clasp
of
his
hand
again
on
his
way
willet
bought
from
a
small
boy
in
the
street
a
copy
each
of
the
weekly
postboy
and
of
the
weekly
gazette
and
mercury
folding
them
carefully
and
putting
them
in
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
i
am
one
to
value
the
news
sheets
he
said
they
dont
tell
everything
but
they
tell
something
and
tis
better
to
know
something
than
nothing
just
a
bit
farther
my
lads
and
well
be
at
the
steps
of
honest
master
hardy
there
you
can
see
where
fortunes
are
made
and
lost
though
were
a
bit
too
late
to
see
the
dealers
he
pointed
to
the
royal
exchange
a
building
used
by
the
merchants
at
the
foot
of
broad
street
a
structure
very
unique
in
its
plan
it
consisted
of
an
upper
story
resting
upon
arches
the
lower
part
therefore
being
entirely
open
beneath
these
arches
the
merchants
met
and
transacted
business
and
also
in
a
room
on
the
upper
floor
where
there
were
too
a
coffee
house
and
a
great
room
used
for
banquets
and
the
meetings
of
societies
the
royal
exchange
being
in
truth
the
beginning
of
many
exchanges
that
now
mark
the
financial
center
of
the
new
world
perhaps
well
see
the
merchants
there
tomorrow
said
willet
youll
note
the
difference
between
new
york
and
quebec
the
french
capital
was
all
military
you
saw
soldiers
everywhere
but
this
is
a
town
of
merchants
now
which
think
you
will
prevail
the
soldiers
or
the
merchants
i
think
that
in
the
end
the
merchants
will
win
replied
robert
and
so
do
i
now
we
have
come
to
the
home
of
master
hardy
see
you
the
big
brick
house
with
high
stone
steps
well
that
is
his
and
i
repeat
that
he
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
a
good
friend
of
old
and
of
today
i
heard
that
in
albany
which
tells
me
we
will
find
him
here
in
his
own
place
but
the
big
brick
house
looked
to
robert
and
tayoga
like
a
fortress
with
its
massive
door
and
ironbarred
windows
although
friendly
smoke
rose
from
a
high
chimney
and
made
a
warm
line
against
the
frosty
blue
air
willet
walked
briskly
up
the
high
stone
steps
and
thundered
on
the
door
with
a
heavy
brass
knocker
the
summons
was
quickly
answered
and
the
door
swung
back
revealing
a
tall
thin
elderly
man
neatly
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
he
had
the
manner
of
one
who
served
although
he
did
not
seem
to
be
a
servant
robert
judged
at
once
that
he
was
an
upper
clerk
who
lived
in
the
house
after
the
custom
of
the
day
is
master
benjamin
within
jonathan
asked
willet
the
tall
man
blinked
and
then
stared
at
the
hunter
in
astonishment
is
it
in
very
truth
you
master
willet
he
exclaimed
none
other
come
jonathan
you
know
my
voice
and
my
face
and
my
figure
very
well
you
could
not
fail
to
recognize
me
anywhere
so
cease
your
doubting
my
young
friends
here
are
robert
lennox
of
whom
you
know
and
tayoga
a
coming
chief
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
known
to
you
as
the
six
nations
hes
impatient
of
disposition
and
unless
you
answer
my
question
speedily
ill
have
him
tomahawk
you
come
now
is
master
benjamin
within
he
is
mr
willet
i
had
no
intent
to
delay
my
answer
but
you
must
allow
something
to
surprise
i
grant
you
pardon
said
the
hunter
whimsically
robert
and
tayoga
this
is
master
jonathan
pillsbury
chief
clerk
and
man
of
affairs
for
master
benjamin
hardy
they
are
two
old
bachelors
who
live
in
the
same
house
and
who
get
along
well
together
because
theyre
so
unlike
as
for
master
jonathan
his
heart
is
not
as
sour
as
his
face
and
you
could
come
to
a
worse
place
than
the
shop
of
benjamin
and
jonathan
master
jonathan
you
will
take
particular
notice
of
mr
lennox
he
is
well
grown
and
he
appears
intelligent
does
he
not
the
old
clerk
blinked
again
and
then
his
appraising
eyes
swept
over
robert
twould
be
hard
to
find
a
nobler
youth
he
said
i
thought
you
would
say
so
and
now
lead
us
without
further
delay
to
master
hardy
who
is
it
who
demands
to
be
led
to
me
thundered
a
voice
from
the
rear
of
the
house
i
seem
to
know
that
voice
ah
its
willet
good
old
willet
honest
dave
who
wields
the
sharpest
sword
in
north
america
a
tall
heavy
man
lunged
forward
lunged
was
the
word
that
described
it
to
robert
and
his
impetuous
motion
was
due
to
the
sight
of
willet
whom
he
grasped
by
both
hands
shaking
them
with
a
vigor
that
would
have
caused
pain
in
one
less
powerful
than
the
hunter
and
as
he
shook
them
he
uttered
exclamations
many
of
them
bordering
upon
oaths
and
all
of
them
pertaining
to
the
sea
roberts
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
half
light
of
the
hall
and
he
took
particular
notice
of
master
benjamin
hardy
who
was
destined
to
become
an
important
figure
in
his
life
although
he
did
not
then
dream
of
it
he
saw
a
tall
man
of
middle
age
built
very
powerfully
his
face
burnt
almost
the
color
of
an
indians
by
the
winds
and
suns
of
many
seas
but
his
hair
was
thick
and
long
and
the
eyes
shining
in
the
face
made
dark
by
the
weather
were
an
intensely
bright
blue
robert
upon
whom
impressions
were
so
swift
and
vivid
reckoned
that
here
was
one
capable
of
great
and
fierce
actions
and
also
with
a
heart
that
contained
a
large
measure
of
kindness
and
generosity
dave
said
the
tall
man
who
carried
with
him
the
atmosphere
of
the
sea
i
feared
that
you
might
be
dead
in
those
forests
you
love
so
well
killed
and
perhaps
scalped
by
the
hurons
or
some
other
savage
tribe
youve
abundant
hair
dave
and
youd
furnish
an
uncommonly
fine
scalp
and
i
feared
benjamin
that
youd
been
caught
in
some
smuggling
cruise
near
the
spanish
main
and
had
been
put
out
of
the
way
by
the
dons
you
love
gain
too
much
ben
old
friend
and
you
court
risks
too
great
for
its
sake
master
benjamin
hardy
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
deeply
and
heartily
the
laugh
seemed
to
robert
to
roll
up
spontaneously
from
his
throat
he
felt
anew
that
here
was
a
man
whom
he
liked
perchance
tis
the
danger
that
draws
me
on
said
master
hardy
you
and
i
are
much
alike
dave
in
the
woods
if
all
that
i
hear
be
true
you
dwell
continually
in
the
very
shadow
of
danger
while
i
incur
it
only
at
times
moreover
i
am
come
to
the
age
of
fifty
years
the
head
is
still
on
my
shoulders
the
breath
is
still
in
my
body
and
master
jonathan
to
whom
figures
are
biblical
says
the
balance
on
my
books
is
excellent
you
talk
oer
much
ben
old
friend
but
since
its
the
way
of
seafaring
men
and
tis
cheerful
it
does
not
vex
my
ears
you
behold
with
me
tayoga
a
youth
of
the
best
blood
of
the
onondaga
nation
one
to
whom
you
will
be
polite
if
you
wish
to
please
me
benjamin
and
master
robert
lennox
grown
perhaps
beyond
your
expectations
master
benjamin
turned
to
robert
and
as
master
jonathan
had
done
measured
him
from
head
to
foot
with
those
intensely
bright
blue
eyes
of
his
that
missed
nothing
grown
greatly
and
grown
well
he
said
but
not
beyond
my
expectations
in
truth
one
could
predict
a
noble
bough
upon
such
a
stem
but
you
and
i
dave
having
many
years
grow
garrulous
and
forget
the
impatience
of
youth
come
lads
well
go
into
the
drawingroom
and
as
supper
was
to
have
been
served
in
half
an
hour
ill
have
the
portions
doubled
robert
smiled
in
albany
and
new
york
alike
he
said
they
welcome
us
to
the
table
which
is
the
utmost
test
of
hospitality
said
master
benjamin
they
went
into
a
great
drawingroom
the
barred
windows
of
which
looked
out
upon
a
busy
street
warehouses
and
counting
houses
and
passing
sailors
robert
was
conscious
all
the
while
that
the
brilliant
blue
eyes
were
examining
him
minutely
his
old
wonder
about
his
parentage
lost
for
a
while
in
the
press
of
war
and
exciting
events
returned
he
felt
intuitively
that
master
hardy
like
willet
knew
who
and
what
he
was
and
he
also
felt
with
the
same
force
that
neither
would
reply
to
any
question
of
his
on
the
subject
so
he
kept
his
peace
and
by
and
by
his
curiosity
as
it
always
did
disappeared
before
immediate
affairs
the
drawingroom
was
a
noble
apartment
with
dark
oaken
beams
a
polished
oaken
floor
upon
which
eastern
rugs
were
spread
and
heavy
tables
of
foreign
woods
a
small
model
of
a
sloop
rested
upon
one
table
and
a
model
of
a
schooner
on
another
here
and
there
were
great
curving
shells
with
interiors
of
pink
and
white
and
upon
the
walls
were
curious
long
crooked
knives
of
the
malay
islands
everything
savored
of
the
sea
again
roberts
imagination
leaped
up
the
blazing
hues
of
distant
tropic
lands
were
in
his
eyes
and
the
odors
of
strange
fruits
and
flowers
were
in
his
nostrils
sit
down
dave
said
master
benjamin
and
you
too
robert
and
tayoga
i
suppose
you
did
not
come
to
new
amsterdamhow
the
name
clingsmerely
to
see
me
that
was
one
purpose
benjamin
replied
willet
but
we
had
others
in
mind
too
to
join
the
war
i
surmise
and
to
get
yourselves
killed
the
first
part
of
your
reckoning
is
true
benjamin
but
not
the
second
we
would
go
to
the
war
in
which
we
have
had
some
part
already
but
not
in
order
that
we
may
be
killed
you
suffer
from
the
common
weakness
one
entering
war
always
thinks
that
its
the
other
man
and
not
he
who
will
be
killed
youre
too
old
for
that
david
willet
laughed
no
benjamin
he
said
im
not
too
old
for
it
and
i
never
will
be
its
the
belief
that
carries
us
all
through
danger
which
way
did
you
think
of
going
in
these
warlike
operations
we
shall
join
the
force
that
comes
out
from
england
the
one
that
will
march
against
fort
duquesne
undoubtedly
i
hear
that
its
to
be
commanded
by
a
general
named
braddock
edward
braddock
what
do
you
know
of
him
nothing
but
you
do
know
david
that
regular
army
officers
fare
ill
in
the
woods
as
a
rule
youve
told
me
often
that
the
savages
are
a
tricky
lot
and
fighting
in
the
forest
in
their
own
way
are
hard
to
beat
you
speak
truth
benjamin
and
ill
not
deny
it
but
there
are
many
of
our
men
in
the
woods
who
know
the
ways
of
the
indians
and
of
the
french
foresters
they
should
be
the
eyes
and
ears
of
general
braddocks
army
well
maybe
maybe
david
but
enough
of
war
for
the
present
one
cannot
talk
about
it
forever
there
are
other
things
under
the
sun
you
will
let
these
lads
see
new
amsterdam
will
you
not
even
tayoga
can
find
something
worth
his
notice
in
the
greatest
port
of
the
new
world
is
any
play
being
given
here
asked
robert
aye
were
having
plays
almost
nightly
replied
master
hardy
and
theyre
being
presented
by
some
very
good
actors
too
lewis
hallam
who
came
several
years
ago
from
goodmans
fields
theater
in
england
and
his
wife
known
on
the
stage
as
mrs
douglas
are
offering
the
best
english
plays
in
new
york
hallam
is
said
to
be
extremely
fine
in
richard
iii
in
which
tragedy
he
first
appeared
here
and
he
gives
it
tomorrow
night
then
were
going
said
robert
eagerly
i
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
i
had
some
thought
of
going
myself
and
if
dave
hasnt
changed
he
has
a
fine
taste
for
the
stage
ill
send
for
seats
and
well
go
together
willets
eyes
sparkled
in
truth
ill
go
too
and
right
gladly
he
said
you
and
i
benjamin
have
seen
the
plays
of
master
shakespeare
together
in
london
and
twill
please
me
mightily
to
see
one
of
them
again
with
you
in
new
york
jonathan
here
will
be
of
our
company
too
will
he
not
master
pillsbury
pursed
his
lips
and
his
expression
became
severe
tis
a
frivolous
way
of
passing
the
time
he
said
but
it
would
be
well
for
one
of
serious
mind
to
be
present
in
order
that
he
might
impose
a
proper
dignity
upon
those
who
lack
it
benjamin
hardy
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
robert
had
never
known
any
one
else
to
laugh
so
deeply
and
with
such
obvious
spontaneity
and
enjoyment
his
lips
curled
up
at
each
end
his
eyes
rolled
back
and
then
fairly
danced
with
mirth
and
his
cheeks
shook
it
was
contagious
not
only
did
master
benjamin
laugh
but
the
others
had
to
laugh
not
excluding
master
jonathan
who
emitted
a
dry
cackle
as
became
one
of
his
habit
and
appearance
do
you
know
dave
old
friend
said
hardy
that
our
good
jonathan
is
really
the
most
wicked
of
us
all
i
go
upon
the
sea
on
these
cruises
which
you
call
smuggling
and
what
not
and
of
which
he
speaks
censoriously
but
if
they
do
not
show
a
large
enough
profit
on
his
books
he
rates
me
most
severely
and
charges
me
with
a
lack
of
enterprise
and
now
he
would
fain
go
to
the
play
to
see
that
we
observe
the
proper
decorum
there
my
lads
you
couldnt
keep
the
sourvisaged
old
hypocrite
from
it
master
jonathan
permitted
himself
a
vinegary
smile
but
made
no
other
reply
and
a
dutch
serving
girl
announcing
that
supper
was
ready
master
hardy
led
them
into
the
diningroom
where
a
generous
repast
was
spread
but
the
room
itself
continued
and
accentuated
the
likeness
of
a
ship
the
windows
were
great
portholes
and
two
large
swinging
lamps
furnished
the
light
pictures
of
naval
worthies
and
of
sea
actions
lined
the
walls
two
or
three
of
the
battle
scenes
were
quite
spirited
and
robert
regarded
them
with
interest
have
you
fought
in
any
of
those
encounters
mr
hardy
he
asked
willet
laid
a
reproving
hand
upon
his
shoulder
twas
a
natural
question
of
yours
robert
he
said
but
tis
the
fashion
here
and
tis
courtesy
too
never
to
ask
benjamin
about
his
past
life
then
he
has
no
embarrassing
questions
to
answer
robert
reddened
and
hardy
broke
again
into
that
deep
spontaneous
laughter
which
in
time
compelled
all
the
others
to
laugh
too
and
with
genuine
enjoyment
dont
believe
all
that
david
tells
you
robert
my
brave
macaroni
he
said
i
may
not
answer
your
questions
but
faith
theyll
never
prove
embarrassing
bear
in
mind
lad
that
our
trade
being
restricted
by
the
mother
country
and
english
subjects
in
this
land
not
having
the
same
freedom
as
english
subjects
in
england
we
must
resort
to
secrecy
and
stratagem
to
obtain
what
our
fellow
subjects
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
may
obtain
openly
and
when
you
grow
older
master
robert
you
will
find
that
its
ever
so
in
the
world
those
to
whom
force
bars
the
way
will
resort
to
wiles
and
stratagems
to
achieve
their
ends
the
fox
has
the
cunning
that
the
bear
lacks
because
he
hasnt
the
bears
strength
lads
you
two
will
sit
together
on
this
side
of
the
table
jonathan
you
take
the
side
next
to
the
portholes
and
david
you
and
i
will
preside
at
the
ends
benjamin
david
and
jonathan
it
has
quite
a
biblical
sound
and
at
least
the
friendship
among
the
three
of
us
despite
the
sourness
of
master
pillsbury
with
which
i
bear
as
best
i
can
is
equal
to
that
of
david
and
jonathan
now
lads
fall
on
and
see
which
of
you
can
keep
pace
with
me
for
i
am
a
mighty
trencherman
meanwhile
tell
us
what
is
passing
here
said
willet
in
the
course
of
the
supper
hardy
talked
freely
of
events
in
new
york
where
a
great
division
of
councils
still
prevailed
shirley
the
warlike
and
energetic
governor
of
massachusetts
had
urged
de
lancy
the
governor
of
new
york
to
join
in
an
expedition
against
the
french
in
canada
but
there
had
been
no
agreement
later
a
number
of
the
royal
governors
expected
to
meet
at
williamsburg
in
virginia
with
dinwiddie
the
governor
of
that
province
at
present
there
are
plans
for
four
enterprises
every
one
of
an
aspiring
nature
he
said
one
expedition
is
to
reduce
nova
scotia
entirely
another
under
governor
shirley
of
massachusetts
is
to
attack
the
french
at
fort
niagara
sir
william
johnson
with
militia
and
mohawks
is
to
head
a
third
against
crown
point
the
fourth
which
i
take
to
be
the
most
important
is
to
be
led
by
general
braddock
against
fort
duquesne
its
object
being
the
recovery
of
the
ohio
country
i
cannot
vouch
for
it
but
such
plans
i
hear
will
be
presented
at
the
conference
of
the
governors
at
williamsburg
as
we
mean
to
go
to
williamsburg
ourselves
said
willet
well
see
what
fortune
general
braddock
may
have
but
now
for
the
sake
of
the
good
lads
well
speak
of
lighter
subjects
where
is
the
play
of
richard
iii
to
be
given
benjamin
mr
hallam
has
obtained
a
great
room
in
a
house
that
is
the
property
of
rip
van
dam
in
nassau
street
he
has
fitted
it
up
in
the
fashion
of
a
stage
and
his
plays
are
always
attended
by
a
great
concourse
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
boston
and
philadelphia
say
new
york
is
light
and
frivolous
but
i
suspect
that
something
of
jealousy
lies
at
the
core
of
the
charge
we
of
new
amsterdamagain
the
name
leaps
to
my
lipshave
a
certain
freedom
in
our
outlook
upon
life
a
freedom
which
i
think
produces
strength
and
not
weakness
manners
are
not
morals
but
i
grow
heavy
and
it
does
not
become
a
seafaring
man
to
be
didactic
what
is
it
piet
the
door
of
the
diningroom
opened
admitting
a
serving
man
who
produced
a
letter
it
comes
by
the
boston
post
he
said
handing
it
to
master
hardy
then
it
must
have
an
importance
which
will
not
admit
delay
in
the
reading
said
master
hardy
your
pardon
friends
while
i
peruse
it
he
read
it
carefully
read
it
again
with
the
same
care
and
then
his
resonant
laughter
boomed
forth
with
such
volume
and
in
such
continuity
that
he
was
compelled
to
take
a
huge
red
handkerchief
and
wipe
the
tears
from
his
eyes
what
is
it
benjamin
that
amuses
you
so
vastly
asked
willet
a
brave
epistle
from
one
of
my
captains
james
dunbar
a
valiant
man
and
a
great
mariner
in
command
of
the
schooner
good
hope
he
was
sailing
from
the
barbados
with
a
cargo
of
rum
and
sugar
for
boston
which
furnishes
a
most
excellent
market
for
both
when
he
was
overhauled
by
the
french
privateer
rocroi
what
do
you
find
to
laugh
at
in
the
loss
of
a
good
ship
and
a
fine
cargo
did
i
say
they
were
lost
nay
david
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
you
dont
know
dunbar
and
you
dont
know
the
good
hope
which
carries
a
brass
twelvepounder
and
fifteen
men
as
valiant
as
dunbar
himself
he
returned
the
attack
of
the
rocroi
with
such
amazing
skill
and
fierceness
that
he
was
able
to
board
her
and
take
her
with
only
three
of
his
men
wounded
and
they
not
badly
moreover
they
found
on
board
the
privateer
a
large
store
of
gold
which
becomes
our
prize
of
war
and
dunbar
and
his
men
shall
have
a
fair
share
of
it
too
how
surprised
the
frenchies
must
have
been
when
dunbar
and
his
sailors
swarmed
aboard
tis
almost
our
only
victory
said
willet
and
im
right
glad
benjamin
it
has
fallen
to
the
lot
of
one
of
your
ships
to
win
it
the
long
supper
which
was
in
truth
a
dinner
was
finished
at
last
hardy
made
good
his
boast
proving
that
he
was
a
mighty
trencherman
pillsbury
pressed
him
closest
and
the
others
although
they
did
well
lingered
at
some
distance
in
the
rear
afterward
they
walked
in
the
town
observing
its
varied
life
and
at
a
late
hour
returned
to
hardys
house
which
he
called
a
mansion
robert
and
tayoga
were
assigned
to
a
room
on
the
second
floor
and
young
lennox
again
noted
the
numerous
evidences
of
opulence
the
furniture
was
mostly
of
carved
mahogany
and
every
room
contained
articles
of
value
from
distant
lands
tayoga
said
robert
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
think
that
the
man
hardy
is
shrewd
dagaeoga
shrewd
like
one
of
our
sachems
and
that
he
has
an
interest
in
you
greater
than
he
would
let
you
see
do
you
remember
him
lennox
no
i
cant
recall
him
tayoga
ive
heard
dave
speak
of
him
many
times
but
whenever
we
were
in
new
york
before
he
was
away
and
we
did
not
even
come
to
his
house
but
he
and
dave
are
friends
of
many
years
i
think
that
long
ago
they
must
have
been
much
together
truly
there
is
some
mystery
here
but
it
can
wait
in
its
proper
time
the
unknown
becomes
the
known
so
it
does
tayoga
and
i
shall
not
vex
my
mind
about
the
matter
just
now
what
i
wish
most
of
all
is
sleep
i
wish
it
too
lennox
but
robert
did
not
sleep
well
his
nerves
being
attuned
more
highly
than
he
had
realized
some
of
the
talk
that
had
passed
between
willet
and
hardy
related
obviously
to
himself
and
in
the
quiet
of
the
room
it
came
back
to
him
he
had
not
slept
more
than
an
hour
when
he
awoke
and
being
unable
to
go
to
sleep
again
sat
up
in
bed
tayoga
was
deep
in
slumber
and
robert
finally
left
the
bed
and
went
to
the
window
the
shutter
of
which
was
not
closed
it
was
a
curious
round
window
like
a
huge
porthole
but
the
glass
was
clear
and
he
had
a
good
view
of
the
street
he
saw
one
or
two
sailors
swaying
rather
more
than
the
customary
motion
of
a
ship
pass
by
and
then
a
watchman
carrying
a
club
in
one
hand
and
a
lantern
in
the
other
and
blowing
his
frosty
breath
upon
his
thick
brown
beard
indicating
that
the
night
although
bright
was
very
cold
he
looked
through
the
glass
at
least
a
half
hour
and
then
turned
back
to
the
bed
but
found
himself
less
inclined
than
ever
to
sleep
throwing
his
coat
over
his
shoulders
he
opened
the
unlocked
door
and
went
into
the
hall
intending
to
walk
back
and
forth
a
little
believing
that
the
easy
exercise
would
induce
desire
for
sleep
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
thread
of
light
in
the
dusk
of
the
hall
at
a
time
when
he
was
quite
sure
everybody
in
the
house
except
himself
was
buried
in
slumber
and
when
he
traced
it
he
found
it
came
from
another
room
farther
down
it
was
upon
the
instant
his
belief
that
robbers
had
entered
in
a
port
like
new
york
where
all
nations
come
there
must
be
reckless
and
desperate
men
who
would
hesitate
at
no
risk
or
crime
he
moved
cautiously
along
the
hall
until
he
reached
the
door
from
which
the
light
shone
it
was
open
about
six
inches
not
allowing
a
look
into
the
room
except
at
the
imminent
risk
of
discovery
but
by
placing
his
ear
at
the
sill
he
would
be
able
to
hear
the
footsteps
of
men
if
they
were
moving
within
the
sound
of
voices
instead
came
to
him
and
as
he
listened
he
was
able
to
note
that
it
was
two
men
talking
in
low
tones
undoubtedly
they
were
robbers
who
were
common
in
all
great
towns
in
those
days
and
this
must
be
a
chamber
in
which
master
hardy
kept
many
valuables
doubtless
they
were
assured
that
everybody
was
deep
in
slumber
or
they
would
be
more
cautious
driven
by
an
intense
curiosity
robert
edged
his
head
a
little
farther
forward
and
was
able
to
look
into
the
room
where
to
his
intense
amazement
he
saw
no
robbers
at
all
but
willet
and
master
hardy
seated
at
a
small
table
opposite
each
other
with
a
candle
account
books
and
papers
between
hardy
had
been
reading
a
paper
and
stopping
at
intervals
to
talk
about
it
with
the
hunter
as
you
see
david
he
said
the
list
of
the
ships
is
three
larger
than
it
was
five
years
ago
one
was
lost
to
the
barbary
corsairs
another
was
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
the
brazils
but
we
have
five
new
ones
you
have
done
well
benjamin
but
i
knew
you
would
said
the
hunter
with
the
help
of
jonathan
dont
forget
him
david
in
name
he
is
my
head
clerk
and
he
pretends
to
serve
me
but
at
times
i
think
he
is
my
master
a
shrewd
massachusetts
man
david
uncommonly
shrewd
and
loyal
too
and
the
lands
benjamin
theyre
in
abeyance
and
are
likely
to
be
for
some
years
their
title
depending
upon
the
course
of
events
which
are
now
in
train
and
theyre
uncertain
benjamin
as
uncertain
as
the
winds
but
give
me
your
honest
opinion
of
the
lad
benjamin
have
i
done
well
with
him
none
could
have
done
better
hes
an
eagle
david
i
marked
him
well
spirit
imagination
force
youth
and
honesty
looking
out
of
his
eyes
but
have
you
no
fears
david
that
you
will
get
him
killed
in
the
wars
i
could
not
keep
him
from
going
to
them
if
i
would
benjamin
there
my
power
stops
you
old
sailors
have
superstitions
or
beliefs
and
i
a
landsman
have
a
conviction
too
the
invisible
prophets
tell
me
that
he
will
not
be
killed
i
dont
laugh
at
such
things
david
the
greatness
and
loneliness
of
the
sea
does
breed
superstition
in
mariners
i
know
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
supernatural
and
yet
i
am
swayed
at
times
by
the
unknown
at
least
i
will
watch
over
him
as
best
i
can
and
he
has
uncommon
skill
in
taking
care
of
himself
roberts
will
triumphed
over
a
curiosity
that
was
intense
and
burning
and
he
turned
away
he
knew
they
were
speaking
of
him
and
he
seemed
to
be
connected
with
great
affairs
it
was
enough
to
stir
the
most
apathetic
youth
and
he
was
just
the
opposite
it
required
the
utmost
exertion
of
a
very
strong
mind
to
pull
himself
from
the
door
and
then
to
drag
his
unwilling
feet
along
the
hall
matter
was
in
complete
rebellion
and
mind
was
compelled
to
win
its
triumph
unaided
but
win
it
did
and
kept
the
victory
he
reached
his
own
room
and
softly
closed
the
door
behind
him
tayoga
was
still
sleeping
soundly
robert
went
again
to
the
window
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
street
but
he
did
not
see
anything
there
because
he
was
looking
inward
the
talk
of
willet
and
hardy
came
back
to
him
he
could
say
it
over
every
word
and
none
could
deny
that
it
was
charged
with
significance
but
he
knew
intuitively
that
neither
of
them
would
answer
a
single
one
of
his
questions
and
he
must
wait
for
time
and
circumstance
to
disclose
the
truth
nor
could
he
bear
to
tell
them
that
he
had
been
listening
at
the
door
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
been
brought
about
by
accident
and
that
he
had
come
away
when
he
might
have
heard
more
having
resigned
himself
to
necessity
he
went
back
to
bed
and
now
youth
triumphing
over
excitement
he
soon
slept
the
next
morning
directly
after
breakfast
the
three
elders
and
the
two
lads
went
to
the
royal
exchange
where
there
was
soon
a
great
concourse
of
merchants
clerks
and
seafaring
men
master
hardy
was
received
with
great
respect
and
many
congratulations
were
given
to
him
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
good
hope
and
captain
dunbar
in
one
of
the
rooms
above
the
pillars
he
met
another
captain
of
his
who
had
arrived
the
day
before
at
new
york
itself
this
captain
a
new
england
man
eliphalet
simmons
had
brought
his
schooner
from
the
mediterranean
and
he
told
in
a
manner
as
brief
and
dry
as
his
own
log
how
he
had
outsailed
one
barbary
corsair
by
day
and
by
changing
his
course
had
tricked
another
in
the
night
but
the
voyage
had
been
most
profitable
and
master
jonathan
duly
entered
the
amount
of
gain
in
an
account
book
with
a
reward
of
ten
pounds
to
captain
simmons
five
pounds
to
the
first
mate
three
pounds
to
the
second
mate
and
one
pound
to
every
member
of
the
crew
for
their
bravery
and
seamanship
captain
simmons
thanks
were
as
brief
and
dry
as
his
report
but
robert
saw
his
eyes
glisten
and
knew
that
he
was
not
lacking
in
gratitude
after
the
business
was
settled
and
the
rewards
adjusted
they
adjourned
to
a
coffee
house
near
hanover
square
where
very
good
madeira
was
brought
and
served
to
the
men
robert
and
tayoga
declining
then
benjamin
david
and
jonathan
drank
to
the
health
of
eliphalet
while
the
two
lads
the
white
and
the
red
devoted
their
attention
to
the
others
in
the
coffee
house
of
whom
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
one
who
sat
at
a
table
very
near
was
already
examining
tayoga
with
the
greatest
curiosity
he
wore
the
uniform
of
an
english
second
lieutenant
very
trim
and
very
red
he
had
an
exceeding
ruddiness
of
countenance
he
was
tall
and
well
built
and
he
was
only
a
year
or
two
older
than
robert
his
curiosity
obviously
had
been
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
tayoga
in
the
full
costume
of
an
iroquois
it
was
equally
evident
to
robert
that
he
was
an
englishman
a
member
of
the
royal
forces
then
in
new
york
americans
still
called
themselves
englishmen
and
robert
instantly
had
a
feeling
of
kinship
for
the
young
officer
who
had
a
frank
and
good
face
the
english
youths
hat
was
lying
upon
the
table
beside
him
and
a
gust
of
wind
blowing
it
upon
the
floor
rolled
it
toward
robert
who
picked
it
up
and
tendered
it
to
its
owner
thanks
said
the
officer
twas
careless
of
me
by
no
means
said
robert
the
wind
blows
when
it
pleases
and
you
were
taken
by
surprise
the
englishman
smiled
showing
very
white
and
even
teeth
i
havent
been
very
long
in
new
york
he
said
but
i
find
it
a
polite
and
vastly
interesting
town
my
name
is
grosvenor
alfred
grosvenor
and
im
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
regiment
of
colonel
brandon
that
arrived
but
recently
from
england
master
hardy
looked
up
and
passed
an
investigating
eye
over
the
young
englishman
youre
related
to
one
of
the
ducal
families
of
england
he
said
but
your
own
immediate
branch
of
it
has
no
overplus
of
wealth
still
your
blood
is
reckoned
highly
noble
in
england
and
you
have
an
excellent
standing
in
your
regiment
both
as
an
officer
and
a
man
young
grosvenors
ruddy
face
became
ruddier
how
do
you
happen
to
know
so
much
about
me
he
asked
but
there
was
no
offense
in
his
tone
hardy
smiled
and
pillsbury
pursing
his
thin
lips
measured
grosvenor
with
his
eyes
i
make
it
my
business
replied
hardy
to
discover
who
the
people
are
who
come
to
new
york
im
a
seafaring
man
and
a
merchant
and
i
find
profit
in
it
its
true
in
especial
since
the
war
has
begun
and
new
york
begins
to
fill
with
the
military
many
of
these
sprightly
young
officers
will
be
wishing
to
borrow
money
from
me
before
long
and
it
will
be
well
for
me
to
know
their
prospects
of
repayment
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
belied
the
irony
of
his
words
and
the
lieutenant
laughed
and
since
youre
alone
continued
the
merchant
we
ask
you
to
join
us
and
will
be
happy
if
you
accept
this
is
mr
robert
lennox
of
very
good
blood
too
and
this
is
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
who
among
his
own
people
has
a
rank
corresponding
to
a
prince
of
the
blood
among
yours
and
who
if
you
value
such
things
is
entitled
therefore
to
precedence
over
all
of
us
including
yourself
mr
david
willet
mr
jonathan
pillsbury
and
mr
benjamin
hardy
who
is
myself
complete
the
catalogue
he
spoke
in
a
tone
half
whimsical
half
earnest
but
the
young
englishman
who
evidently
had
a
friendly
and
inquiring
mind
received
it
in
the
best
spirit
and
gladly
joined
them
he
was
soon
deep
in
the
conversation
but
his
greatest
interest
was
for
tayoga
from
whom
he
could
seldom
take
his
eyes
it
was
evident
to
robert
that
he
had
expected
to
find
only
a
savage
in
an
indian
and
the
delicate
manners
and
perfect
english
of
the
onondaga
filled
him
with
surprise
i
would
fain
confess
he
said
at
length
that
america
is
not
what
i
expected
to
find
i
did
not
know
that
it
contained
princes
who
could
put
some
of
our
own
to
shame
he
bowed
to
tayoga
who
smiled
and
replied
what
small
merit
i
may
possess
is
due
to
the
training
of
my
people
do
you
expect
early
service
lieutenant
grosvenor
mr
hardy
asked
not
immediatei
think
i
may
say
so
much
replied
the
englishman
but
i
understand
that
our
regiment
will
be
with
the
first
force
that
takes
the
field
that
of
general
braddock
tis
well
known
that
we
intend
to
march
against
fort
duquesne
an
expedition
that
should
be
easy
a
powerful
army
like
general
braddocks
can
brush
aside
any
number
of
forest
rovers
robert
and
willet
exchanged
glances
but
the
face
of
tayoga
remained
a
mask
its
not
well
to
take
the
french
and
indians
too
lightly
said
mr
hardy
with
gravity
but
wandering
bands
cant
face
cannon
and
the
bayonet
they
dont
have
to
face
em
they
lie
hid
on
your
flank
and
cut
you
down
while
your
fire
and
steel
waste
themselves
on
the
uncomplaining
forest
they
were
words
which
were
destined
to
come
back
to
robert
some
day
with
extraordinary
force
but
for
the
present
they
were
a
mere
generalization
that
did
not
stay
long
in
his
mind
our
leaders
will
take
all
the
needful
precautions
said
young
grosvenor
with
confidence
mr
hardy
did
not
insist
but
spoke
of
the
play
they
expected
to
witness
that
evening
suggesting
to
lieutenant
grosvenor
if
he
had
leave
that
he
go
with
them
an
invitation
that
was
accepted
promptly
and
with
warmth
the
liking
between
him
and
robert
while
of
sudden
birth
was
destined
to
be
strong
and
permanent
there
was
much
similarity
of
temperament
grosvenor
also
was
imaginative
and
curious
his
mind
invariably
projected
itself
into
the
future
and
he
was
eager
to
know
he
had
come
to
america
inquiring
without
prejudices
wishing
to
find
the
good
rather
than
the
bad
and
he
esteemed
it
a
great
stroke
of
fortune
that
he
should
make
so
early
the
acquaintance
of
two
such
remarkable
youths
as
robert
and
tayoga
the
three
men
with
them
were
scarcely
less
interesting
and
he
knew
that
in
their
company
at
the
play
they
would
talk
to
him
of
strange
new
things
he
would
be
exploring
a
world
hidden
from
him
hitherto
and
nothing
could
have
appealed
to
him
more
you
landed
a
week
ago
said
hardy
truly
sir
laughed
grosvenor
you
seem
to
know
not
only
who
i
am
but
what
i
do
and
then
as
youve
had
a
certain
amount
of
military
duty
although
tis
not
excessive
youve
had
little
chance
to
see
this
most
important
town
of
ours
can
you
not
join
this
company
of
mine
at
my
house
for
supper
and
then
well
all
go
together
to
the
play
ill
obtain
your
seat
for
you
with
great
pleasure
sir
replied
grosvenor
twill
be
easy
for
me
to
secure
the
needed
leave
and
ill
be
at
your
house
with
promptness
he
departed
presently
for
his
quarters
and
the
three
men
also
went
away
together
on
an
errand
of
business
leaving
robert
and
tayoga
to
go
whithersoever
they
pleased
and
it
pleased
them
to
wander
along
the
shores
of
the
port
young
lennox
was
impressed
more
than
ever
by
the
great
quantity
of
shipping
and
the
extreme
activity
of
the
town
the
war
with
france
so
far
from
interfering
with
this
activity
had
but
increased
it
privateering
was
a
great
pursuit
of
the
day
all
nations
deeming
it
legal
and
worthy
in
war
and
bold
and
enterprising
merchants
like
mr
hardy
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
it
the
weekly
news
sheets
that
willet
had
bought
contained
lists
of
vessels
captured
already
and
roberts
hasty
glances
showed
him
that
at
least
sixty
or
seventy
had
been
taken
by
the
privateers
out
of
new
york
most
of
the
prizes
had
been
in
the
west
india
trade
although
some
had
been
captured
far
away
near
the
coast
of
africa
and
nearly
all
had
been
loaded
richly
they
saw
several
of
the
privateers
in
port
armed
powerfully
and
as
they
were
usually
built
for
speed
robert
admired
their
graceful
lines
he
felt
anew
the
difference
between
military
quebec
and
commercial
new
york
quebec
was
prepared
to
send
forth
forces
for
destruction
but
here
lifegiving
commerce
flowed
in
and
flowed
out
again
through
arteries
continually
increasing
in
number
and
power
once
again
came
to
him
the
thought
that
the
merchant
more
than
the
soldier
was
the
builder
of
a
great
nation
the
impression
made
upon
him
was
all
the
more
vivid
because
new
york
even
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
it
was
in
its
infancy
surprised
even
travelers
from
europe
with
its
manifold
activities
and
intense
energy
after
a
day
long
but
of
extraordinary
interest
they
returned
to
the
house
of
mr
hardy
where
grosvenor
joined
them
in
half
an
hour
and
then
after
another
abundant
supper
they
all
went
to
the
play
chapter
xi
the
play
they
were
all
arrayed
in
their
very
best
clothes
even
master
jonathan
having
powdered
his
hair
and
tied
it
in
an
uncommonly
neat
queue
while
his
buckled
shoes
stockings
and
small
clothes
though
of
somewhat
ancient
fashion
were
of
fine
quality
mr
hardy
gazed
at
him
admiringly
jonathan
he
said
you
are
usually
somewhat
sour
of
visage
but
upon
occasion
you
can
ruffle
it
with
the
best
macaroni
of
them
all
master
jonathan
pursed
his
lips
and
smiled
with
satisfaction
all
of
them
in
truth
presented
a
most
gallant
appearance
but
by
far
the
most
noticeable
figure
was
that
of
tayoga
indians
often
appeared
in
new
york
but
such
indians
as
the
young
onondaga
were
rare
anywhere
he
rose
half
a
head
above
the
ordinary
man
and
he
wore
the
costume
of
a
chief
of
the
mighty
league
of
the
hondenosaunee
the
feathers
in
his
lofty
headdress
blowing
back
defiantly
with
the
wind
he
attracted
universal
and
at
the
same
time
respectful
attention
they
were
preceded
by
a
stout
link
boy
who
bore
aloft
a
blazing
torch
and
as
they
walked
toward
the
building
in
nassau
street
owned
by
rip
van
dam
in
which
the
play
was
to
be
given
they
overtook
others
who
were
upon
the
same
errand
a
carriage
drawn
by
two
large
white
horses
conveyed
governor
de
lancey
and
his
wife
and
another
very
much
like
it
bore
his
brotherinlaw
the
conspicuous
john
watts
and
mrs
watts
all
of
them
saw
mr
hardy
and
his
party
and
bowed
to
them
with
great
politeness
robert
already
understood
enough
of
the
world
to
know
that
it
denoted
much
importance
on
the
part
of
the
merchant
a
man
of
influence
in
our
community
said
master
benjamin
speaking
of
mr
watts
an
uncommonly
clear
mind
and
much
firmness
and
decision
he
will
leave
a
great
name
in
new
york
as
he
spoke
they
overtook
a
tall
youth
about
twentythree
years
old
walking
alone
and
dressed
in
the
very
latest
fashion
out
of
england
mr
hardy
hailed
him
with
great
satisfaction
and
asked
him
to
join
them
master
edward
charterisa
who
is
soon
to
become
a
member
of
the
royal
americans
he
said
to
the
others
he
is
a
native
of
this
town
and
belongs
to
one
of
our
best
families
here
when
he
does
become
a
royal
american
he
will
probably
have
the
finest
uniform
in
his
regiment
because
edward
sets
the
styles
in
raiment
for
young
men
of
his
age
here
footnote
a
the
story
of
edward
charteris
and
his
adventures
at
ticonderoga
and
quebec
are
told
in
the
authors
novel
a
soldier
of
manhattan
charteris
smiled
it
was
evident
that
he
and
the
older
man
were
on
the
most
friendly
footing
but
he
held
himself
with
dignity
and
had
pride
qualities
which
robert
liked
in
him
his
manner
was
most
excellent
too
when
mr
hardy
introduced
all
of
his
party
in
turn
and
he
readily
joined
them
speaking
of
his
pleasure
in
doing
so
i
shall
be
able
to
exchange
my
seat
and
obtain
one
with
you
he
said
we
shall
be
early
but
i
am
glad
of
it
mr
hallam
and
his
fine
company
have
been
performing
in
philadelphia
and
as
we
now
welcome
them
back
to
new
york
nearly
all
the
notable
people
of
our
city
will
be
present
unless
mr
hardy
wishes
to
do
so
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
point
them
out
to
you
no
no
exclaimed
master
benjamin
the
task
is
yours
edward
my
lad
you
can
put
more
savor
and
unction
into
it
than
i
can
then
let
it
be
understood
that
im
the
guide
and
expounder
laughed
charteris
he
has
a
great
pride
in
his
city
and
it
wont
suffer
from
his
telling
said
master
benjamin
they
were
now
in
nassau
street
near
the
improvised
theater
and
many
other
link
boys
holding
aloft
their
torches
were
preceding
their
masters
and
mistresses
heavy
coaches
were
rolling
up
and
men
and
women
in
gorgeous
costumes
were
emerging
from
them
the
display
of
wealth
was
amazing
for
a
town
in
the
new
world
but
mr
hardy
and
his
company
quickly
went
inside
and
obtained
their
seats
from
which
they
watched
the
fashion
of
new
york
enter
charteris
knew
them
all
and
to
many
of
them
he
was
related
the
number
of
de
lanceys
was
surprising
and
there
was
also
a
profusion
of
livingstons
the
two
families
between
them
seeming
to
dominate
the
city
although
they
lived
in
bitter
rivalry
as
charteris
whispered
to
robert
there
were
also
wattses
and
morrises
and
crugers
and
waltons
and
van
rensselaers
van
cortlandts
and
kennedys
and
barclays
and
nicolls
and
alexanders
and
numerous
others
that
endured
for
generations
in
new
york
the
diverse
origin
of
these
names
english
scotch
dutch
and
huguenot
french
showed
even
at
such
an
early
date
the
cosmopolitan
nature
of
new
york
that
it
was
destined
to
maintain
robert
was
intensely
interested
charteris
fund
of
information
was
wonderful
and
he
flavored
it
with
a
salt
of
his
own
he
not
only
knew
the
people
but
he
knew
all
about
them
their
personal
idiosyncrasies
their
rivalries
and
jealousies
robert
soon
gathered
that
new
york
was
not
only
a
seething
city
commercially
but
socially
as
well
family
was
of
extreme
importance
and
the
great
landed
proprietors
who
had
received
extensive
grants
along
the
hudson
in
the
earlier
days
from
the
dutch
government
still
had
and
exercised
feudal
rights
and
were
as
full
of
pride
and
haughtiness
as
ducal
families
in
europe
class
distinctions
were
preserved
to
the
utmost
possible
extent
and
while
the
original
basis
of
the
town
had
been
dutch
the
fashion
was
now
distinctly
english
london
set
the
style
for
everything
when
they
were
all
seated
the
display
of
fine
dress
and
jewels
was
extraordinary
just
as
the
wealth
and
splendor
shown
in
some
of
the
new
york
houses
had
already
attracted
the
astonished
attention
of
many
of
the
british
officers
to
whom
the
finest
places
in
their
own
country
were
familiar
and
while
robert
was
looking
so
eagerly
the
party
to
which
he
belonged
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
any
means
master
benjamin
hardy
was
well
known
he
was
bold
and
successful
and
he
was
a
man
of
great
substance
he
had
qualities
that
commanded
respect
in
colonial
new
york
and
people
were
not
averse
to
being
seen
receiving
his
friendly
nod
and
those
who
surrounded
him
and
who
were
evidently
his
guests
were
worthy
of
notice
too
there
was
edward
charteris
as
well
born
as
any
in
the
hall
and
a
pattern
in
manners
and
dress
for
the
young
men
of
new
york
and
there
was
the
tall
youth
with
the
tanned
face
and
the
wonderful
vivid
eyes
who
must
surely
by
his
appearance
be
the
representative
of
some
noble
family
there
was
the
young
indian
chief
uncommon
in
height
and
with
the
dignity
and
majesty
of
the
forest
an
indian
whose
like
had
never
been
seen
in
new
york
before
and
there
was
the
gigantic
willet
whose
massive
head
and
calm
face
were
so
redolent
of
strength
beyond
all
question
it
was
a
most
unusual
and
striking
company
that
master
benjamin
hardy
had
brought
with
him
and
old
and
young
whispered
together
as
they
looked
at
them
especially
at
robert
and
tayoga
mr
hardy
was
conscious
of
the
stir
he
had
made
and
he
liked
it
not
for
himself
alone
but
also
for
another
he
glanced
at
robert
and
saw
how
finely
and
clearly
his
features
were
cut
how
clear
was
the
blue
of
his
eyes
and
the
great
width
between
them
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
tis
a
good
youth
nature
lineage
and
willet
have
done
well
he
said
to
himself
more
of
the
fashion
of
new
york
came
in
and
then
a
group
of
british
officers
several
of
whom
nodded
to
grosvenor
the
tall
man
with
the
gray
hair
at
the
temples
is
my
colonel
brandon
he
said
very
strict
but
just
to
his
men
and
we
like
him
he
spent
some
years
in
the
service
of
the
east
india
company
in
one
of
the
hottest
parts
of
the
peninsula
thats
why
hes
so
brown
and
it
made
his
blood
thin
too
he
cant
endure
cold
the
officer
with
him
is
one
of
our
majors
apthorpe
he
has
had
less
experience
than
the
colonel
but
thinks
he
knows
more
his
opinion
of
the
french
is
very
poor
believes
we
ought
to
brush
em
aside
with
ease
i
hope
you
dont
think
that
way
grosvenor
said
robert
we
in
this
country
know
that
the
french
is
one
of
the
most
valiant
races
the
world
has
produced
and
so
do
most
thinking
englishmen
the
only
victories
we
boast
much
about
are
those
we
have
won
over
the
french
which
shows
that
we
consider
them
foes
worthy
of
anybodys
steel
but
the
play
is
going
to
begin
i
believe
the
hall
is
well
filled
now
and
im
not
trying
to
make
an
appeal
to
your
local
pride
lennox
when
i
tell
you
tis
an
audience
that
will
compare
well
with
one
at
drury
lane
or
covent
garden
for
splendor
and
for
variety
twill
excel
it
robert
was
pleased
secretly
although
more
identified
with
albany
than
new
york
he
considered
himself
nevertheless
one
of
the
people
who
belonged
to
the
city
at
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
and
he
felt
already
its
coming
greatness
we
call
ourselves
englishmen
he
said
modestly
and
we
hope
to
achieve
as
much
as
the
older
englishmen
our
brethren
across
the
seas
have
you
seen
many
plays
lennox
but
few
and
none
by
great
actors
like
mr
hallam
and
mrs
douglas
i
suppose
grosvenor
youve
seen
so
many
that
theyre
no
novelty
to
you
i
can
scarcely
lay
claim
to
being
such
a
man
about
town
as
that
i
have
seen
plays
of
course
and
some
by
the
great
master
will
and
i
do
confess
that
the
mock
life
i
behold
beyond
the
footlights
often
thrills
me
more
than
the
real
life
i
see
this
side
of
them
once
i
witnessed
this
play
richard
iii
which
we
are
now
about
to
see
and
it
stirred
me
so
i
could
scarce
contain
myself
though
some
do
say
that
our
shakespeare
has
made
the
hunchback
king
blacker
than
he
really
was
presently
a
little
bell
rang
the
curtain
rolled
up
and
robert
passed
into
an
enchanted
land
to
vivid
and
imaginative
youth
the
great
style
and
action
of
shakespeare
make
an
irresistible
appeal
robert
had
never
seen
one
of
the
mighty
bards
plays
before
and
now
he
was
in
another
world
of
romance
and
tragedy
suffused
with
poetry
and
he
was
held
completely
by
the
spell
shakespeare
may
have
blackened
the
character
of
the
hunchback
but
robert
believed
him
absolutely
to
him
richard
was
exactly
what
the
play
made
him
although
the
stage
was
but
a
temporary
one
built
in
the
hall
of
rip
van
dam
it
was
large
the
seating
capacity
was
great
and
hallam
and
his
wife
were
among
the
best
actors
of
their
day
destined
to
a
long
career
as
stars
in
the
colonies
and
also
afterward
when
they
ceased
to
be
colonies
they
and
an
able
support
soon
took
the
whole
audience
captive
and
all
fashionable
and
unfashionable
alike
hung
with
breathless
attention
upon
the
play
robert
forgot
absolutely
everything
around
him
willet
was
carried
back
to
days
of
his
youth
and
master
benjamin
hardy
who
at
heart
was
a
lover
of
adventure
and
romance
responded
to
the
great
speeches
the
author
has
written
for
his
characters
tayoga
did
not
stir
his
face
of
bronze
was
unmoved
but
now
and
then
his
dark
eyes
gleamed
in
reality
the
influence
of
the
tragedy
upon
tayoga
was
as
great
as
it
was
upon
robert
the
onondaga
had
an
unusual
mind
and
being
sent
at
an
early
age
to
school
at
albany
he
had
learned
that
the
difference
between
white
man
and
red
was
due
chiefly
to
environment
their
hopes
and
fears
their
rivalries
and
ambitions
were
in
truth
about
the
same
he
had
seen
in
some
chief
a
soul
much
like
that
of
humpbacked
richard
but
as
he
looked
and
listened
he
also
had
a
certain
feeling
of
superiority
as
he
saw
it
the
great
league
the
hodenosaunee
was
governed
better
than
england
when
york
and
lancaster
were
tearing
it
to
pieces
the
fifty
old
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
would
decide
more
wisely
and
more
justly
than
the
english
nobles
tayoga
in
that
moment
was
prouder
than
ever
that
he
was
born
a
member
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
and
doubtless
his
patron
saint
tododaho
in
his
home
on
the
great
shining
star
agreed
with
him
the
first
act
closed
amid
great
applause
several
recalls
of
smiling
and
bowing
actors
followed
and
then
during
the
wait
came
a
great
buzz
of
talk
robert
shook
himself
and
returned
to
the
world
what
do
you
like
best
about
it
lennox
asked
grosvenor
the
poetry
the
things
the
people
say
things
ive
thought
often
myself
but
which
i
havent
been
able
to
put
in
a
way
that
makes
them
strike
upon
you
like
a
lightning
flash
i
think
that
describes
master
will
in
truth
youve
given
me
a
description
for
my
own
feelings
once
more
i
repeat
to
you
lennox
that
tis
a
fine
audience
i
see
here
much
british
and
dutch
wealth
and
people
whose
lives
have
been
a
continuous
drama
truly
its
so
said
robert
and
as
his
examining
eye
swept
the
crowd
he
almost
rose
in
his
seat
with
astonishment
with
difficulty
suppressing
a
cry
then
he
charged
himself
with
being
a
fool
it
could
not
be
so
the
thing
was
incredible
the
man
might
look
like
him
but
surely
he
would
not
be
so
reckless
as
to
come
to
such
a
place
then
he
looked
again
and
he
could
no
longer
doubt
the
stranger
sat
near
the
door
and
his
dress
was
much
like
that
of
a
prosperous
seafaring
man
of
the
dutch
race
but
robert
knew
the
blue
eyes
lofty
and
questing
like
those
of
the
eagle
and
he
was
sure
that
the
reddish
beard
had
grown
on
a
face
other
than
the
one
it
now
adorned
it
was
st
luc
whom
he
knew
to
be
romantic
adventurous
and
ready
for
any
risk
robert
moved
his
body
forward
a
little
in
order
that
it
might
be
directly
between
tayoga
and
the
frenchman
it
being
his
first
impulse
to
shelter
st
luc
from
the
next
person
who
was
likely
to
recognize
him
but
the
onondaga
was
not
looking
in
that
direction
the
young
english
officer
moved
by
his
intense
interest
had
engaged
him
in
conversation
continually
surprised
that
tayoga
should
know
so
much
about
the
white
race
and
history
robert
looked
so
long
at
st
luc
and
with
such
a
fixed
and
powerful
gaze
that
at
last
the
chevalier
turned
and
their
eyes
met
roberts
said
why
are
you
here
your
life
is
in
danger
every
moment
if
caught
you
will
be
executed
as
a
spy
im
not
afraid
replied
the
eyes
of
st
luc
you
alone
have
seen
me
as
i
am
but
others
will
see
you
i
think
not
how
do
you
know
that
i
will
not
proclaim
at
once
who
you
are
you
will
not
because
you
do
not
wish
to
see
me
hanged
or
shot
then
the
eyes
of
st
luc
left
robert
and
wandered
ever
the
audience
which
was
now
deeply
engrossed
in
talk
although
the
livingstons
and
the
de
lanceys
kept
zealously
away
from
one
another
and
the
families
who
were
closely
allied
with
them
by
blood
politics
or
business
also
stayed
near
their
chiefs
robert
began
to
fancy
that
he
might
have
been
mistaken
it
was
not
really
st
luc
he
had
allowed
an
imaginary
resemblance
to
impose
upon
him
but
reflection
told
him
that
it
was
no
error
he
would
have
known
the
intense
gaze
of
those
burning
blue
eyes
anywhere
he
was
still
careful
to
keep
his
own
body
between
tayoga
and
the
frenchman
the
curtain
rose
and
once
more
robert
fell
under
the
great
writers
spell
vivid
action
and
poetic
speech
claimed
him
anew
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
st
luc
when
the
second
act
was
finished
and
while
the
applause
was
still
filling
the
hall
he
cast
a
fearful
glance
toward
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
chevalier
then
in
truth
he
rubbed
his
eyes
no
st
luc
was
there
the
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
was
not
empty
but
was
occupied
by
a
stolid
stout
dutchman
who
seemed
not
to
have
moved
for
hours
it
had
been
a
vision
a
figment
of
the
fancy
after
all
but
it
was
merely
an
attempt
of
the
will
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
so
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
had
seen
st
luc
who
probably
listening
to
some
counsel
of
providence
had
left
the
hall
robert
felt
an
immense
relief
and
now
he
was
able
to
assume
his
best
manner
when
mr
hardy
began
to
present
him
and
tayoga
to
many
of
the
notables
he
met
the
governor
mr
watts
and
more
de
lanceys
wilsons
and
crugers
than
he
could
remember
and
he
received
invitations
to
great
houses
and
made
engagements
which
he
intended
to
keep
if
it
were
humanly
possible
willet
and
hardy
exchanged
glances
when
they
noticed
how
easily
he
adapted
himself
to
the
great
world
of
his
day
he
responded
here
as
he
had
responded
in
quebec
although
quebec
and
new
york
each
a
center
in
its
own
way
were
totally
unlike
the
play
went
on
and
robert
was
still
absorbed
in
the
majestic
lines
at
the
next
intermission
there
was
much
movement
in
the
audience
people
walked
about
old
acquaintances
spoke
and
strangers
were
introduced
to
one
another
robert
looked
sharply
for
st
luc
but
there
was
no
trace
of
him
presently
mr
hardy
was
introducing
him
to
a
heavy
man
dressed
very
richly
and
obviously
full
of
pride
mynheer
van
zoon
he
said
this
is
young
robert
lennox
he
has
been
for
years
in
the
care
of
david
willet
whom
you
have
met
in
other
and
different
times
robert
mynheer
van
zoon
is
one
of
our
greatest
merchants
and
one
of
my
most
active
rivals
robert
was
about
to
extend
his
hand
but
noticing
that
mynheer
van
zoon
did
not
offer
his
he
withheld
his
own
the
merchants
face
in
truth
had
turned
to
deeper
red
than
usual
and
his
eyes
lowered
he
was
a
few
years
older
than
hardy
somewhat
stouter
and
his
heavy
strong
features
showed
a
tinge
of
cruelty
the
impression
that
he
made
upon
robert
was
distinctly
unfavorable
yes
i
have
met
mr
willet
before
said
van
zoon
but
so
many
years
have
passed
that
i
did
not
know
whether
he
was
still
living
i
can
say
the
same
about
young
mr
lennox
oh
they
live
hazardous
lives
but
when
one
is
skilled
in
meeting
peril
life
is
not
snuffed
out
so
easily
rejoined
mr
hardy
who
seemed
to
be
speaking
from
some
hidden
motive
theyve
returned
to
civilization
and
i
think
and
trust
adrian
that
well
hear
more
of
them
than
for
some
years
past
theyre
especial
friends
of
mine
and
i
shall
do
the
best
i
can
for
them
even
though
my
mercantile
rivalry
with
you
absorbs
of
necessity
so
much
of
my
energy
van
zoon
smiled
sourly
and
then
robert
liked
him
less
than
ever
the
times
are
full
of
danger
he
said
and
one
must
watch
to
keep
his
own
he
bowed
and
turned
to
other
acquaintances
evidently
relieved
at
parting
with
them
he
does
not
improve
with
age
said
willet
thoughtfully
robert
was
about
to
ask
questions
concerning
this
adrian
van
zoon
who
seemed
uneasy
in
their
presence
but
once
more
he
restrained
himself
his
intuition
telling
him
as
before
that
neither
willet
nor
master
hardy
would
answer
them
the
play
moved
on
towards
its
dramatic
close
and
robert
was
back
in
the
world
of
passion
and
tragedy
of
fancy
and
poetry
van
zoon
was
forgotten
st
luc
faded
quite
away
and
he
was
not
conscious
of
the
presence
of
tayoga
or
of
grosvenor
or
of
any
of
his
friends
shakespeares
richard
was
wholly
the
humpbacked
villain
to
him
and
when
he
met
his
fate
on
bosworth
field
he
rejoiced
greatly
as
the
curtain
went
down
for
the
last
time
he
saw
that
tayoga
too
was
moved
the
english
king
was
a
wicked
man
he
said
but
he
died
like
a
great
chief
they
all
passed
out
now
the
street
was
filled
with
carriages
and
the
torches
of
the
link
boys
and
there
was
a
great
hum
of
conversation
st
luc
returned
to
roberts
mind
but
he
kept
to
himself
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
the
theater
it
might
be
his
duty
to
state
to
the
military
that
he
had
seen
in
the
city
an
important
frenchman
who
must
have
come
as
a
spy
but
he
could
not
do
so
nor
did
he
feel
any
pricklings
of
the
conscience
about
it
because
he
believed
even
if
he
gave
warning
of
st
lucs
presence
the
wary
chevalier
would
escape
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
watching
the
carriages
great
highbodied
vehicles
roll
away
mr
hardy
had
a
carriage
of
his
own
but
the
distance
between
his
house
and
the
theater
was
so
short
that
he
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
use
it
the
night
was
clear
very
cold
and
the
illusion
of
the
play
was
still
upon
the
younger
members
of
his
group
you
liked
it
said
mr
hardy
looking
keenly
at
robert
it
was
another
and
wonderful
world
to
me
replied
the
youth
i
thought
it
would
make
a
great
appeal
to
you
said
master
benjamin
your
type
of
mind
always
responds
quickly
to
the
poetic
drama
ah
there
goes
mynheer
adrian
van
zoon
he
has
entered
his
carriage
without
looking
once
in
our
direction
he
and
willet
and
master
jonathan
laughed
together
softly
but
with
evident
zest
whatever
the
feeling
between
them
and
whatever
the
cause
might
be
robert
felt
that
they
had
the
advantage
of
mynheer
van
zoon
that
night
and
were
pushing
it
they
watched
the
crowd
leave
and
the
lights
fade
in
the
darkness
and
then
they
walked
back
together
to
the
solid
red
brick
house
of
mr
hardy
where
grosvenor
took
leave
of
them
all
promising
that
the
acquaintance
should
be
continued
a
fine
young
man
said
mr
hardy
thoughtfully
i
wish
that
more
of
his
kind
would
come
over
we
can
find
great
use
for
them
in
this
country
charteris
also
said
farewell
to
them
telling
them
that
his
own
house
was
not
far
away
and
offering
them
his
services
in
any
way
they
wished
as
long
as
they
remained
in
the
city
another
fine
young
man
said
master
benjamin
as
the
tall
figure
of
charteris
melted
away
in
the
darkness
a
good
representative
of
our
citys
best
blood
and
manners
and
yes
of
morals
too
robert
went
alone
the
next
morning
to
the
new
public
library
founded
the
year
before
and
known
as
the
new
york
society
library
a
novelty
then
and
a
great
evidence
of
municipal
progress
the
most
eminent
men
of
the
city
appointed
by
governor
de
lancey
were
its
trustees
and
the
collection
already
being
large
robert
spent
a
happy
hour
or
two
glancing
through
the
books
history
and
fiction
appealed
most
to
him
but
he
merely
looked
a
little
here
and
there
opening
many
volumes
he
was
proud
that
the
intelligence
and
enterprise
of
new
york
had
founded
so
noble
an
institution
and
he
promised
himself
that
if
in
the
time
to
come
he
should
be
a
permanent
resident
of
the
city
his
visits
there
would
be
frequent
when
he
left
the
library
it
was
about
noon
the
day
being
cloudy
and
dark
with
flurries
of
snow
those
who
were
in
the
streets
shivering
with
the
raw
cold
robert
drew
his
own
heavy
cloak
closely
about
him
and
bending
his
head
a
little
strolled
toward
the
battery
in
order
to
look
again
at
the
ships
that
came
from
so
many
parts
of
the
earth
a
stranger
walking
in
slouching
fashion
and
with
the
collar
of
his
coat
pulled
well
up
about
his
face
shambled
directly
in
his
way
when
robert
turned
the
man
turned
also
and
said
in
a
low
tone
mr
lennox
st
luc
exclaimed
robert
are
you
quite
mad
dont
you
know
that
your
life
is
in
danger
every
instant
i
am
not
mad
nor
is
the
risk
as
great
as
you
think
walk
on
by
my
side
as
if
you
knew
me
i
did
not
think
chevalier
that
your
favorite
role
was
that
of
a
spy
nor
is
it
this
new
york
of
yours
is
a
busy
city
and
a
man
even
a
frenchman
may
come
here
for
other
reasons
than
to
learn
military
secrets
robert
stared
at
him
but
st
luc
admonished
him
again
to
look
in
front
of
him
and
walk
on
as
if
they
were
old
acquaintances
on
some
business
errand
i
dont
think
you
want
to
betray
me
to
the
english
he
said
no
i
dont
said
robert
though
my
duty
perhaps
should
make
me
do
so
but
you
wont
i
felt
assured
of
it
else
i
should
not
have
spoken
to
you
what
duty
other
than
that
of
a
spy
can
have
brought
you
to
new
york
why
make
it
a
duty
it
is
true
the
times
are
troubled
and
full
of
wars
but
one
on
occasion
may
seek
his
pleasure
nevertheless
let
us
say
that
i
came
to
new
york
to
see
the
play
which
both
of
us
witnessed
last
night
twas
excellently
done
i
have
seen
plays
presented
in
worse
style
at
much
more
pretentious
theaters
in
paris
moreover
i
a
frenchman
love
shakespeare
i
consider
him
the
equal
of
our
magnificent
moliere
which
means
that
if
you
were
not
a
frenchman
you
would
think
him
better
a
pleasant
wit
mr
lennox
i
am
glad
to
see
it
in
you
but
you
will
admit
that
i
have
come
a
long
distance
and
incurred
a
great
risk
to
attend
a
play
by
a
british
author
given
in
a
british
town
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
british
town
has
strong
dutch
lineaments
furthermore
i
do
bear
witness
that
i
enjoyed
the
play
greatly
twas
worth
the
trouble
and
the
danger
since
you
insist
chevalier
that
you
came
so
great
a
distance
and
incurred
so
great
a
risk
merely
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
our
shakespeare
as
one
gentleman
to
another
i
cannot
say
that
i
doubt
your
word
but
when
we
sailed
down
the
hudson
on
a
sloop
and
were
compelled
to
tie
up
in
a
cove
to
escape
the
wrath
of
a
storm
i
saw
you
on
the
slope
above
me
i
saw
you
too
then
mr
lennox
and
i
envied
you
your
snug
place
on
the
sloop
that
storm
was
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
incidents
in
my
long
journey
to
new
york
to
see
shakespeares
richard
iii
still
when
one
wishes
a
thing
very
badly
one
must
be
willing
to
pay
a
high
price
for
it
it
was
a
good
play
by
a
good
writer
the
actors
were
most
excellent
and
i
have
had
sufficient
reward
for
my
trouble
and
danger
the
collar
of
his
cloak
was
drawn
so
high
now
that
it
formed
almost
a
hood
around
his
head
and
face
but
he
turned
a
little
and
robert
saw
the
blue
eyes
as
blue
as
his
own
twinkling
with
a
humorous
light
it
was
borne
upon
him
with
renewed
force
that
here
was
a
champion
of
romance
and
high
adventure
st
luc
was
a
survival
he
was
one
of
those
knights
of
the
middle
ages
who
rode
forth
with
lance
and
sword
to
do
battle
perhaps
for
a
ladys
favor
and
perhaps
to
crush
the
infidel
his
own
spirit
which
had
in
it
a
lightness
a
gayety
and
a
humor
akin
to
st
lucs
responded
at
once
since
you
found
the
play
most
excellent
and
i
had
the
same
delight
i
presume
that
you
will
stay
for
all
the
others
mr
hallam
and
his
fine
company
are
in
new
york
for
two
weeks
if
not
longer
having
come
so
far
and
at
such
uncommon
risks
you
will
not
content
yourself
with
a
single
performance
alas
that
is
the
poison
in
my
cup
the
leave
of
absence
given
me
by
the
governor
general
of
canada
is
but
brief
and
i
can
remain
in
this
city
and
stronghold
of
my
enemy
but
a
single
night
they
passed
several
men
but
none
took
any
notice
of
them
the
day
had
increased
in
gloominess
heavy
clouds
were
coming
up
from
the
sea
enveloping
the
solid
town
in
a
thick
and
somber
atmosphere
snow
began
to
fall
and
a
sharp
wind
drove
the
flakes
before
it
pedestrians
bent
forward
and
drew
their
cloaks
or
coats
about
their
faces
to
protect
themselves
from
the
storm
the
weather
favors
us
said
st
luc
the
people
of
new
york
defending
themselves
from
the
wind
and
the
flakes
will
have
no
time
to
be
looking
for
an
enemy
among
them
where
are
we
going
chevalier
that
i
know
not
but
being
young
healthy
and
strong
perhaps
we
walk
in
a
circle
for
the
sake
of
exercise
for
which
also
you
have
come
to
new
yorkin
order
that
you
may
walk
about
our
battery
and
bowling
green
true
quite
true
you
have
a
most
penetrating
mind
mr
lennox
and
since
we
speak
of
the
objects
of
my
errand
here
i
recall
a
third
but
of
course
a
minor
motive
i
am
interested
in
that
third
and
minor
motive
chevalier
de
st
luc
i
noticed
last
night
at
the
play
that
you
were
speaking
to
a
merchant
one
adrian
van
zoon
tis
true
but
how
do
you
know
van
zoon
let
it
suffice
lad
that
i
know
him
and
know
him
well
i
wish
you
to
beware
of
him
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
softness
of
tone
that
touched
robert
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
meaning
was
good
they
were
still
walking
in
the
most
casual
manner
their
faces
bent
to
the
driving
snow
and
almost
hidden
by
the
collars
of
their
cloaks
what
can
adrian
van
zoon
and
i
have
in
common
asked
robert
lad
i
bid
thee
again
to
beware
of
him
look
to
it
that
you
do
not
fall
into
his
treacherous
hands
his
sudden
use
of
the
pronoun
thee
and
his
intense
earnestness
stirred
robert
deeply
friends
seem
to
rise
around
me
due
to
no
merit
of
mine
he
said
willet
has
always
watched
over
me
tayoga
is
my
brother
jacobus
huysman
has
treated
me
almost
as
his
own
son
and
master
benjamin
hardy
has
received
me
with
great
warmth
of
heart
and
now
you
deliver
to
me
a
warning
that
i
cannot
but
believe
is
given
with
the
best
intent
but
again
i
ask
you
why
should
i
fear
adrian
van
zoon
that
lad
i
will
not
tell
you
but
once
more
i
bid
you
beware
of
him
think
you
id
have
taken
such
a
risk
to
prepare
you
for
a
danger
if
it
were
not
real
i
do
not
i
feel
chevalier
de
st
luc
that
you
are
a
friend
in
truth
shall
i
speak
of
this
to
mr
willet
he
will
not
blame
me
for
hiding
the
knowledge
of
your
presence
here
no
keep
it
to
yourself
but
once
more
i
tell
you
beware
of
adrian
van
zoon
now
you
will
not
see
me
again
for
a
long
time
and
perhaps
it
will
be
on
the
field
of
battle
have
no
fears
for
my
safety
i
can
leave
this
solid
town
of
yours
as
easily
as
i
entered
it
farewell
farewell
said
robert
with
a
real
wrench
at
the
heart
st
luc
left
him
and
walked
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
st
georges
chapel
the
snow
increased
so
much
and
was
driving
so
hard
that
in
forty
or
fifty
paces
he
disappeared
entirely
and
robert
wishing
shelter
went
back
to
the
house
of
benjamin
hardy
moved
by
many
and
varied
emotions
he
could
not
doubt
that
st
lucs
warning
was
earnest
and
important
but
why
should
he
have
incurred
such
great
risks
to
give
it
what
was
he
to
adrian
van
zoon
and
what
was
adrian
van
zoon
to
him
and
what
did
the
talk
at
night
between
willet
and
hardy
mean
he
seemed
to
be
the
center
of
a
singular
circle
of
complications
of
which
other
people
might
know
much
but
of
which
he
knew
nothing
mr
hardys
house
was
very
solid
very
warm
and
very
comfortable
he
was
still
at
the
royal
exchange
but
mr
pillsbury
had
come
home
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
a
great
fire
his
coattails
drawn
under
either
arm
in
front
of
him
a
gleam
of
warmth
appeared
in
his
solemn
eyes
at
the
sight
of
robert
a
fierce
day
master
robert
he
said
tis
good
at
such
a
time
to
stand
before
a
red
fire
like
this
and
have
stout
walls
between
one
and
the
storm
spoken
truly
master
jonathan
said
robert
as
he
joined
him
before
the
fire
and
imitated
his
position
you
have
been
to
our
new
city
library
we
are
quite
proud
of
it
yes
i
was
there
but
i
have
also
been
thinking
a
little
thought
never
hurts
one
we
should
all
be
better
if
we
took
more
thought
upon
ourselves
i
was
thinking
of
a
man
whom
we
saw
at
the
play
last
night
the
merchant
adrian
van
zoon
master
jonathan
let
his
coattails
fall
from
under
his
arms
and
then
he
deliberately
gathered
them
up
again
a
wealthy
and
powerful
merchant
he
has
ships
on
many
seas
i
have
inferred
that
mr
hardy
does
not
like
him
considering
my
words
carefully
i
should
say
that
mr
hardy
does
not
like
mr
van
zoon
and
that
mr
van
zoon
does
not
like
mr
hardy
im
not
seeking
to
be
intrusive
but
is
it
just
business
rivalry
you
are
not
intrusive
master
robert
but
my
knowledge
seldom
extends
beyond
matters
of
business
which
means
that
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
but
you
deem
it
wiser
not
to
do
so
the
storm
increases
master
robert
the
snow
is
almost
blinding
i
repeat
that
it
is
a
most
excellent
fire
before
which
we
are
standing
mr
hardy
and
your
friends
will
be
here
presently
and
we
shall
have
food
it
seems
to
me
master
jonathan
that
the
people
of
new
york
eat
much
and
often
it
sustains
life
and
confers
a
harmless
pleasure
to
return
a
moment
to
adrian
van
zoon
you
say
that
his
ships
are
upon
every
sea
in
what
trade
are
they
engaged
mostly
in
almost
everything
master
robert
they
say
he
does
much
smugglingbut
i
dont
object
to
a
decent
bit
of
smugglingand
i
fear
that
certain
very
fast
vessels
of
his
know
more
than
a
little
about
the
slave
trade
i
trust
that
mr
hardy
has
never
engaged
in
such
a
traffic
you
may
put
your
mind
at
rest
upon
that
point
master
robert
no
amount
of
profit
could
induce
mr
hardy
to
engage
in
such
commerce
mr
hardy
tayoga
and
willet
came
in
presently
and
the
merchant
remained
a
while
after
his
dinner
the
older
men
smoked
pipes
and
talked
together
and
robert
and
tayoga
looked
out
at
the
driving
snow
tayoga
had
received
a
letter
from
colonel
william
johnson
that
morning
informing
him
that
all
was
well
at
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
the
young
onondaga
was
pleased
they
were
speaking
of
their
expected
departure
to
join
braddocks
army
but
they
had
heard
from
willet
that
they
were
to
remain
longer
than
they
had
intended
in
new
york
as
the
call
to
march
demanded
no
hurry
chapter
xii
the
slaver
robert
spent
more
days
in
new
york
and
they
were
all
pleasant
his
own
handsome
face
and
winning
manner
would
have
made
his
way
anywhere
but
it
became
known
universally
that
a
great
interest
was
taken
in
him
by
mr
benjamin
hardy
who
was
a
great
figure
in
the
city
a
man
not
to
be
turned
lightly
into
an
enemy
it
also
seemed
that
some
mystery
enveloped
himmystery
always
attractsand
the
lofty
and
noble
figure
of
the
young
onondaga
who
was
nearly
always
by
his
side
heightened
the
romantic
charm
he
had
for
all
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
both
hardy
and
willet
urged
him
to
go
wherever
he
was
asked
by
the
great
and
clothes
fitted
to
such
occasions
were
provided
promptly
i
am
not
able
to
pay
for
these
said
robert
to
willet
when
he
was
being
measured
for
the
first
of
his
fine
raiment
dont
trouble
yourself
about
it
said
the
hunter
smiling
i
have
sufficient
to
meet
the
bills
and
i
shall
see
that
all
your
tailors
are
reimbursed
duly
some
one
must
always
look
after
a
man
of
fashion
i
wish
i
knew
more
than
i
do
said
robert
in
troubled
tones
because
ive
a
notion
that
the
money
with
which
you
will
pay
my
tailor
comes
from
the
till
of
master
benjamin
hardy
its
uncommon
strange
that
he
does
so
much
for
me
im
very
grateful
but
surely
there
must
be
some
motive
behind
it
he
glanced
at
willet
to
see
how
he
took
his
words
but
the
hunter
merely
smiled
and
robert
knew
that
the
smile
was
a
mask
through
which
he
could
not
penetrate
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
thee
said
the
hunter
i
will
said
robert
cheerfully
since
it
seems
i
cant
do
anything
else
and
he
did
his
response
to
new
york
continued
to
be
as
vigorous
as
it
had
been
to
quebec
and
while
new
york
lacked
some
of
the
brilliancy
some
of
the
ultimate
finish
that
to
his
mind
had
distinguished
quebec
it
was
more
solid
there
was
more
of
an
atmosphere
of
resource
and
it
was
all
vastly
interesting
charteris
proved
himself
a
right
true
friend
and
he
opened
for
him
whatever
doors
he
cared
to
enter
that
mr
hardy
may
have
left
unlocked
he
was
also
thrown
much
with
grosvenor
and
the
instinctive
friendship
between
the
two
ripened
fast
on
the
fifth
day
of
his
stay
in
new
york
a
letter
came
out
of
the
wilderness
from
wilton
at
fort
refuge
it
had
been
brought
by
an
oneida
runner
to
albany
and
was
sent
thence
by
post
to
new
york
wilton
wrote
that
time
would
pass
rather
heavily
with
them
in
the
little
fortress
if
the
hostile
indians
allowed
it
small
bands
now
infested
that
region
and
the
soldiers
were
continually
making
marches
against
them
the
strange
man
whom
they
called
black
rifle
was
of
vast
help
guiding
them
and
saving
them
from
ambush
wilton
wrote
that
he
missed
philadelphia
which
was
certainly
the
finest
city
outside
of
europe
but
he
hoped
to
go
back
to
it
seasoned
and
improved
by
life
in
the
woods
new
york
where
he
supposed
robert
now
to
be
was
an
attractive
town
in
truth
a
great
port
but
it
had
not
the
wealth
and
cultivation
of
philadelphia
as
he
hoped
to
show
robert
some
day
meanwhile
he
wished
him
well
robert
smiled
he
had
pleasant
memories
of
wilton
colden
carson
and
the
others
and
while
he
was
making
new
friends
he
did
not
commit
the
crime
of
forgetting
old
ones
it
was
his
hope
that
he
should
meet
them
all
again
not
merely
after
the
war
but
long
before
in
his
comings
and
goings
among
the
great
of
their
day
robert
kept
a
keen
eye
for
the
vision
of
st
luc
he
half
hoped
half
feared
that
some
time
in
the
twilight
or
the
full
dusk
of
the
night
he
would
see
in
some
narrow
street
the
tall
figure
wrapped
in
its
great
cloak
but
the
chevalier
did
not
appear
and
robert
felt
that
he
had
not
really
come
as
a
spy
upon
the
english
army
and
its
preparations
he
must
have
gone
days
since
he
met
adrian
van
zoon
three
times
that
is
he
was
in
the
same
room
with
him
although
they
spoke
together
only
once
the
merchant
had
in
his
presence
an
air
of
detachment
he
seemed
to
be
one
who
continually
carried
a
burden
and
a
stripling
just
from
the
woods
could
not
long
have
a
place
either
favorable
or
unfavorable
in
his
memory
robert
began
to
wonder
if
st
luc
had
net
been
mistaken
what
could
a
man
born
and
bred
in
france
and
only
in
recent
years
an
inhabitant
of
canada
know
of
adrian
van
zoon
of
new
york
what
above
all
could
he
know
that
would
cause
him
to
warn
robert
against
him
but
this
like
all
his
other
questions
disappeared
in
the
enjoyments
of
the
moment
nature
which
had
been
so
kind
in
giving
to
him
a
vivid
imagination
had
also
given
with
it
an
intense
appreciation
he
liked
nearly
everything
and
nearly
everybody
he
could
see
a
rosy
mist
where
the
ordinary
man
saw
only
a
cloud
and
just
now
new
york
was
so
kind
to
him
that
he
loved
it
all
a
week
in
the
city
and
he
attended
a
brilliant
ball
given
by
william
walton
in
the
walton
mansion
in
franklin
square
then
the
most
elaborate
and
costly
home
in
north
america
it
was
like
a
great
english
country
house
with
massive
brick
walls
and
woodwork
all
imported
and
beautifully
carved
the
staircase
in
particular
made
of
dark
ebony
was
the
wonder
of
its
day
and
in
truth
the
whole
interior
was
like
that
of
a
palace
instead
of
a
private
residence
at
that
time
in
america
robert
enjoyed
himself
hugely
he
realized
anew
how
close
was
the
blood
relationship
among
all
those
important
families
and
he
was
already
familiar
with
their
names
the
powerful
sponsorship
of
mr
hardy
had
caused
them
to
take
him
in
as
one
of
their
number
and
for
that
reason
he
liked
them
all
the
more
he
was
worldly
wise
enough
already
to
know
that
we
are
more
apt
to
call
a
social
circle
snobbish
when
we
do
not
belong
to
it
now
he
was
a
welcome
visitor
at
the
best
houses
in
new
york
and
all
was
rose
to
him
adrian
van
zoon
who
had
not
only
wealth
but
strong
connections
was
there
but
as
on
recent
occasions
he
took
no
notice
of
robert
until
late
in
the
evening
when
the
guests
were
dancing
the
latest
paris
and
london
dances
in
the
great
drawingroom
robert
was
resting
for
a
little
space
and
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
the
merchant
drew
near
him
and
addressed
him
with
much
courtesy
i
fear
mr
lennox
he
said
that
i
have
spoken
to
you
rather
brusquely
for
which
i
offer
many
apologies
it
was
due
perhaps
to
the
commercial
rivalries
of
myself
and
mr
hardy
in
whose
house
you
are
staying
it
was
but
natural
for
me
to
associate
you
with
him
i
wish
to
be
linked
with
him
said
robert
coldly
i
have
a
great
liking
and
respect
for
mr
hardy
mynheer
van
zoon
laughed
and
seemed
not
at
all
offended
the
answer
of
a
lad
and
a
proper
one
for
a
lad
he
said
tis
well
to
be
loyal
to
ones
friends
and
i
must
admit
too
that
mr
hardy
is
a
man
of
many
high
qualities
a
fact
that
a
rivalry
in
business
extending
over
many
years
has
proved
to
me
he
and
i
cannot
become
friends
but
i
do
respect
him
he
had
imparted
some
warmth
to
his
tone
and
his
manner
bore
the
appearance
of
geniality
robert
so
susceptible
to
courtesy
in
others
began
to
find
him
less
repellent
he
rejoined
in
the
same
polite
manner
and
mynheer
van
zoon
talked
to
him
a
little
while
as
a
busy
man
of
middle
age
would
speak
to
a
youth
he
asked
him
of
his
experiences
at
quebec
of
which
he
had
heard
some
rumor
and
robert
out
of
the
fullness
of
his
mind
spoke
freely
on
that
subject
is
it
true
asked
mynheer
van
zoon
that
david
willet
in
a
duel
with
swords
slew
a
famous
bravo
its
quite
true
replied
robert
i
was
there
and
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
pierre
boucher
was
the
mans
name
and
never
was
a
death
more
deserved
willet
is
a
marvel
with
the
sword
you
knew
him
in
his
youth
mynheer
van
zoon
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
possible
that
i
was
thinking
of
some
one
who
had
talked
to
me
about
him
but
whatever
thought
may
have
been
in
my
mind
david
willet
and
i
are
not
likely
to
tread
the
same
path
i
repeat
master
lennox
that
although
my
manner
may
have
seemed
to
you
somewhat
brusque
in
the
past
i
wish
you
well
do
you
remain
much
longer
in
new
york
only
a
few
days
i
think
and
you
still
find
much
of
interest
to
see
enough
to
occupy
the
remainder
of
my
time
i
wish
to
see
a
bit
of
long
island
but
tomorrow
i
go
to
paulus
hook
to
find
one
nicholas
suydam
and
to
carry
him
a
message
from
colonel
william
johnson
which
has
but
lately
come
to
me
in
the
post
i
suppose
it
will
be
easy
to
get
passage
across
the
hudson
plenty
of
watermen
will
take
you
for
a
fare
but
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
oars
yourself
it
would
be
fine
exercise
for
a
strong
youth
like
you
to
row
over
and
then
back
again
its
a
good
suggestion
as
i
do
row
and
i
think
ill
adopt
it
mynheer
van
zoon
passed
on
a
moment
or
two
later
and
robert
with
his
extraordinary
susceptibility
to
a
friendly
manner
felt
a
pleasant
impression
surely
st
luc
who
at
least
was
an
official
enemy
did
not
know
the
truth
about
van
zoon
and
if
the
frenchman
did
happen
to
be
right
what
did
he
have
to
fear
in
new
york
surrounded
by
friends
the
evening
progressed
but
mynheer
van
zoon
left
early
and
then
in
the
pleasures
of
the
hour
surrounded
by
youth
and
brightness
robert
forgot
him
too
a
banquet
was
served
late
and
there
was
such
a
display
of
silver
and
gold
plate
that
the
british
officers
themselves
opened
their
eyes
and
later
wrote
letters
to
england
telling
of
the
amazing
prosperity
and
wealth
of
new
york
as
proven
by
what
they
had
seen
in
the
walton
and
other
houses
robert
did
not
go
back
to
the
home
of
mr
hardy
until
a
very
late
hour
and
he
slept
late
the
next
day
when
he
rose
he
found
that
all
except
himself
had
gone
forth
for
one
purpose
or
another
but
it
suited
his
own
plan
well
as
he
could
now
take
the
letter
of
colonel
william
johnson
to
his
friend
master
nicholas
suydam
in
paulus
hook
it
was
another
dark
gloomy
day
but
clouds
and
cold
had
little
effect
on
his
spirits
and
when
he
walked
along
the
shore
of
the
north
river
looking
for
a
boat
he
met
the
chaff
of
the
watermen
with
humorous
remarks
of
his
own
they
discouraged
his
plan
to
row
himself
across
but
being
proud
of
his
skill
he
clung
to
it
and
having
deposited
two
golden
guineas
as
security
for
its
return
he
selected
a
small
but
strong
boat
and
rowed
into
the
stream
a
sharp
wind
was
blowing
in
from
the
sea
but
he
was
able
to
manage
his
little
craft
with
ease
and
being
used
to
rough
water
he
enjoyed
the
rise
and
dip
of
the
waves
a
third
of
the
way
out
and
he
paused
and
looked
back
at
new
york
the
steeple
of
st
georges
showing
above
the
line
of
houses
he
could
distinguish
from
the
mass
other
buildings
that
he
knew
and
his
heart
suddenly
swelled
with
affection
for
this
town
in
which
he
had
received
such
a
warm
welcome
he
would
certainly
live
here
when
the
wars
were
over
and
he
could
settle
down
to
his
career
then
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
inner
bay
where
he
saw
the
usual
amount
of
shipping
sloops
schooners
brigs
and
every
other
kind
of
vessel
known
to
the
times
behind
them
rose
the
high
wooded
shores
of
staten
island
and
through
the
channel
between
it
and
long
island
robert
saw
other
ships
coming
in
truly
it
was
a
noble
bay
apparently
made
for
the
creation
of
a
great
port
and
already
busy
man
was
putting
it
to
its
appointed
use
then
he
looked
up
the
hudson
at
the
lofty
palisades
the
precipitous
shores
facing
them
and
his
eyes
came
back
to
the
stream
several
vessels
under
full
sail
were
steering
for
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
but
he
looked
longest
at
a
schooner
painted
a
dark
color
and
very
trim
in
her
lines
he
saw
two
men
standing
on
her
decks
and
two
or
three
others
visible
in
her
rigging
evidently
she
was
a
neat
and
speedy
craft
but
he
was
not
there
to
waste
his
time
looking
at
schooners
the
letter
of
colonel
william
johnson
to
master
nicholas
suydam
in
paulus
hook
must
be
delivered
and
taking
up
his
oars
he
rowed
vigorously
toward
the
hamlet
on
the
jersey
shore
when
he
was
about
twothirds
of
the
way
across
he
paused
to
look
back
again
but
the
air
was
so
heavy
with
wintry
mists
that
new
york
did
not
show
at
all
he
was
about
to
resume
the
oars
once
more
when
the
sound
of
creaking
cordage
caused
him
to
look
northward
then
he
shouted
in
alarm
the
dark
schooner
was
bearing
down
directly
upon
him
and
was
coming
very
swiftly
a
man
on
the
deck
whom
he
took
to
be
the
captain
shouted
at
him
but
when
robert
pulling
hard
shot
his
boat
ahead
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
schooner
changed
her
course
also
it
was
the
last
impression
he
had
of
the
incident
as
the
prow
of
the
schooner
struck
his
boat
and
clove
it
in
twain
he
jumped
instinctively
but
his
head
received
a
glancing
blow
and
he
did
not
remember
anything
more
until
he
awoke
in
a
very
dark
and
close
place
his
head
ached
abominably
and
when
he
strove
to
raise
a
hand
to
it
he
found
that
he
could
not
do
so
he
thought
at
first
that
it
was
due
to
weakness
a
sort
of
temporary
paralysis
coming
from
the
blow
that
he
dimly
remembered
but
he
realized
presently
that
his
hands
were
bound
tied
tightly
to
his
sides
he
moved
his
body
a
little
and
it
struck
against
wood
on
either
side
his
feet
also
were
bound
and
he
became
conscious
of
a
swaying
motion
he
was
in
a
ships
bunk
and
he
was
a
prisoner
of
somebody
he
was
filled
with
a
fierce
and
consuming
rage
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
on
the
schooner
that
had
run
him
down
nor
did
he
doubt
either
that
he
had
been
run
down
purposely
then
he
lay
still
and
by
long
staring
was
able
to
make
out
a
low
swaying
roof
above
him
and
very
narrow
walls
it
was
a
strait
confined
place
and
it
was
certainly
deep
down
in
the
schooners
hold
a
feeling
of
horrible
despair
seized
him
the
darkness
his
aching
head
and
his
bound
hands
and
feet
filled
him
with
the
worst
forebodings
nor
did
he
have
any
way
of
estimating
time
he
might
have
been
lying
in
the
bunk
at
least
a
week
and
he
might
now
be
far
out
at
sea
in
misfortune
the
intelligent
and
imaginative
suffer
most
because
they
see
and
feel
everything
and
also
foresee
further
misfortunes
to
come
roberts
present
position
brought
to
him
in
a
glittering
train
all
that
he
had
lost
having
a
keen
social
sense
his
life
in
new
york
had
been
one
of
continuing
charm
now
the
balls
and
receptions
that
he
had
attended
at
great
houses
came
back
to
him
even
more
brilliant
and
vivid
than
their
original
colors
had
been
he
remembered
the
many
beautiful
women
he
had
seen
in
their
dresses
of
silk
or
satin
with
their
rosy
faces
and
powdered
hair
and
the
great
merchants
and
feudal
landowners
and
the
british
and
american
officers
in
their
bright
new
uniforms
talking
proudly
of
the
honors
they
expected
to
win
then
that
splendid
dream
was
gone
vanishing
like
a
mist
before
a
wind
and
he
was
back
in
the
swaying
darkness
of
the
bunk
hands
and
feet
bound
and
head
aching
all
things
are
relative
he
felt
now
if
only
the
cruel
cords
were
taken
off
his
wrists
and
ankles
he
could
be
happy
then
he
would
be
able
to
sit
up
move
his
limbs
and
his
head
would
stop
aching
he
called
all
the
powers
of
his
will
to
his
aid
since
he
could
not
move
he
would
not
cause
himself
any
increase
of
pain
by
striving
to
do
so
he
commanded
his
body
to
lie
still
and
compose
itself
and
it
obeyed
in
a
little
while
his
head
ceased
to
ache
so
fiercely
and
the
cords
did
not
bite
so
deep
then
he
took
thought
he
was
still
sure
that
he
was
on
board
the
schooner
that
had
run
him
down
he
remembered
the
warning
of
st
luc
against
adrian
van
zoon
and
adrian
van
zoons
suggestion
that
he
row
his
own
boat
across
to
paulus
hook
but
it
seemed
incredible
a
merchant
a
rich
man
of
high
standing
in
new
york
could
not
plan
his
murder
where
was
the
motive
and
if
such
a
motive
did
exist
a
man
of
van
zoons
standing
could
not
afford
to
take
so
great
a
risk
in
spite
of
st
luc
and
his
faith
in
him
he
dismissed
it
as
an
impossibility
if
van
zoon
had
wished
his
death
he
would
not
have
been
taken
out
of
the
river
he
must
seek
elsewhere
the
reason
of
his
present
state
he
listened
attentively
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
creaking
and
groaning
of
the
cordage
increased
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
heard
footsteps
over
his
head
but
he
concluded
that
it
was
merely
the
imagination
then
after
an
interminable
period
of
waiting
the
door
to
the
room
opened
and
a
man
carrying
a
ships
lantern
entered
followed
closely
by
another
robert
was
able
to
turn
on
his
side
and
stare
at
them
the
one
who
carried
the
lantern
was
short
very
dark
and
had
gold
rings
in
his
ears
robert
judged
him
to
be
a
portuguese
but
his
attention
quickly
passed
to
the
man
behind
him
who
was
much
taller
rather
spare
his
face
clean
shaven
his
hard
blue
eyes
set
close
together
robert
knew
instinctively
that
he
was
master
of
the
ship
hold
up
the
lantern
miguel
the
tall
man
said
and
lets
have
a
look
at
him
the
portuguese
obeyed
then
robert
felt
the
hard
blue
eyes
fastened
upon
him
but
he
raised
himself
as
much
as
he
could
and
gave
back
the
gaze
fearlessly
well
hows
our
sailorman
said
the
captain
laughing
and
his
laughter
was
hideous
to
the
prisoner
i
dont
understand
you
said
robert
my
meaning
is
plain
enough
i
take
it
i
demand
that
you
set
me
free
at
once
and
restore
me
to
my
friends
in
new
york
the
tall
man
laughed
until
he
held
his
sides
and
the
short
man
laughed
with
him
laugh
for
laugh
their
laughter
so
filled
robert
with
loathing
and
hate
that
he
would
have
attacked
them
both
had
he
been
unbound
come
now
peter
said
the
captain
at
last
enough
of
your
grand
manner
you
carry
it
well
for
a
common
sailor
and
old
nick
himself
knows
where
you
got
your
fine
clothes
but
here
you
are
back
among
your
old
comrades
and
you
ought
to
be
glad
to
see
em
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
astonished
robert
now
dont
look
so
surprised
you
can
keep
up
a
play
too
long
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
youre
plain
peter
smith
an
able
young
sailorman
when
youre
willing
who
deserted
us
in
baltimore
three
months
ago
and
you
with
a
year
yet
to
serve
and
heres
your
particular
comrade
miguel
so
glad
to
see
you
when
we
ran
your
boat
down
all
your
own
fault
too
miguel
jumped
overboard
and
he
didnt
dream
that
the
lad
he
was
risking
his
life
to
save
was
his
old
chum
oh
twas
a
pretty
reunion
and
now
peter
thank
miguel
for
bringing
you
back
to
life
and
to
us
a
singular
spirit
seized
robert
he
saw
that
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
these
men
who
utterly
without
scruple
wished
for
some
reason
to
hold
him
he
could
be
a
player
too
and
perhaps
more
was
to
be
won
by
being
a
player
im
sorry
he
said
but
i
was
tempted
by
the
follies
of
the
land
and
ive
had
enough
of
em
if
youll
overlook
it
and
let
the
past
be
buried
captain
youll
have
no
better
seaman
than
peter
smith
youve
always
been
a
just
but
kind
man
and
so
i
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
the
captain
and
miguel
exchanged
astonished
glances
i
know
youll
do
it
captain
robert
went
on
in
his
most
winning
tones
because
as
ive
just
said
youve
always
been
a
kind
man
especially
kind
to
me
i
suppose
when
i
first
signed
with
you
that
i
was
as
ignorant
and
awkward
a
land
lubber
as
you
ever
saw
but
your
patient
teaching
has
made
me
a
real
sailor
release
me
now
and
i
think
that
in
a
few
hours
i
will
be
fit
to
go
to
work
again
cut
the
lashings
miguel
said
the
captain
miguels
sharp
knife
quickly
severed
them
and
robert
sat
up
in
the
bunk
when
the
blood
began
to
flow
freely
in
the
veins
cut
off
hitherto
he
felt
stinging
pains
at
first
but
presently
heavenly
relief
came
the
captain
and
miguel
stood
looking
at
him
peter
said
the
captain
you
were
always
a
lad
of
spirit
and
im
glad
to
get
you
back
particularly
as
we
have
such
a
long
voyage
ahead
of
us
one
doesnt
go
to
the
coast
of
africa
gather
a
cargo
of
slaves
and
get
back
in
a
day
in
spite
of
himself
robert
could
not
repress
a
shudder
of
horror
a
slaver
and
he
a
prisoner
on
board
her
he
might
be
gone
a
year
or
more
never
was
a
lad
in
worse
case
but
somewhere
in
him
was
a
spark
of
hope
that
refused
to
be
extinguished
he
gave
a
more
imperious
summons
than
ever
to
his
will
and
it
returned
to
his
aid
youve
been
kind
to
peter
smith
few
captains
would
forgive
what
ive
done
but
ill
try
to
make
it
up
to
you
how
long
are
we
out
from
new
york
he
said
it
might
be
an
hour
or
it
might
be
a
day
or
whats
more
likely
it
might
be
two
days
you
see
peter
a
lad
who
gets
a
crack
on
the
head
like
yours
lies
still
and
asleep
for
a
long
time
besides
it
dont
make
any
difference
to
you
how
long
weve
been
out
so
just
you
stay
in
your
bunk
a
little
while
longer
and
miguel
will
bring
you
something
to
eat
and
drink
thank
you
captain
youre
almost
a
father
to
me
thats
a
good
lad
peter
i
am
your
father
im
the
father
of
all
my
crew
and
dont
forget
that
a
father
sometimes
has
to
punish
his
children
so
just
you
stay
in
your
bunk
till
youre
bid
to
come
out
of
it
thank
you
captain
i
wouldnt
think
of
disobeying
you
besides
im
too
weak
to
move
yet
the
captain
and
miguel
went
out
and
robert
heard
them
fastening
the
door
on
the
outside
then
the
darkness
shut
him
in
again
and
he
lay
back
in
his
bunk
the
spark
of
hope
somewhere
in
his
mind
had
grown
a
little
larger
his
head
had
ceased
to
ache
and
his
limbs
were
free
the
physical
difference
made
a
mental
difference
yet
greater
although
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
no
way
out
he
would
find
one
the
door
was
opened
again
and
miguel
bearing
the
ships
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
of
food
in
the
other
came
in
it
was
rough
food
such
as
was
served
on
rough
ships
but
robert
sat
up
and
looked
at
it
hungrily
miguel
grinned
and
laughed
until
the
gold
hoops
in
his
ears
shook
you
peter
smith
he
said
me
terrible
glad
to
see
you
again
miss
my
old
comrade
mourn
for
him
and
then
when
find
him
jump
into
the
cold
river
to
save
him
its
true
said
robert
it
was
a
long
and
painful
parting
but
here
we
are
shipmates
again
it
was
good
of
you
miguel
to
risk
your
life
to
save
me
and
now
that
weve
had
so
many
polite
interchanges
suppose
you
save
me
from
starving
to
death
and
pass
that
plate
of
food
with
ver
good
will
peter
eat
eat
with
the
great
heartiness
because
we
have
ver
ver
hard
work
before
us
and
for
a
long
time
the
captain
will
want
you
to
do
as
much
work
in
tree
mont
as
tree
men
do
so
you
can
make
up
the
tree
mont
you
have
lost
tell
him
im
ready
ive
already
confessed
all
my
sins
to
him
he
wont
let
you
work
as
sailor
at
first
he
make
you
help
me
in
the
cooks
galley
im
willing
to
do
that
too
you
know
i
can
cook
youll
remember
miguel
how
i
helped
you
in
the
mediterranean
and
how
i
did
almost
all
your
work
that
time
you
were
sick
when
we
were
cruising
down
to
the
brazils
miguel
grinned
you
have
the
great
courage
you
peter
he
said
you
always
have
feel
better
now
a
lot
miguel
the
bread
was
hard
i
suppose
and
better
potatoes
have
been
grown
but
i
didnt
notice
the
difference
that
was
good
water
too
ive
always
thought
that
water
was
a
fine
drink
and
now
miguel
hunger
and
thirst
being
satisfied
ill
get
up
and
stretch
my
limbs
a
while
then
ill
be
ready
to
go
to
work
i
tell
you
when
the
captain
wants
you
maybe
an
hour
from
now
maybe
two
hours
he
took
his
lantern
and
the
empty
plate
and
withdrew
but
robert
heard
him
fastening
the
door
on
the
outside
again
evidently
they
did
not
yet
wholly
trust
the
good
intentions
of
peter
smith
the
deserter
whom
they
had
recaptured
in
the
hudson
but
the
spark
of
hope
lodged
somewhere
in
the
mind
of
peter
smith
was
still
growing
and
glowing
the
removal
of
the
bonds
from
his
wrist
and
ankles
had
brought
back
a
full
and
free
circulation
and
the
food
and
water
had
already
restored
strength
to
one
so
young
and
strong
he
stood
up
flexed
his
muscles
and
took
deep
breaths
he
had
no
familiarity
with
the
sea
but
he
was
used
to
navigation
in
canoes
and
boats
on
large
and
small
lakes
in
the
roughest
kind
of
weather
and
the
rocking
of
the
schooner
which
continued
did
not
make
him
seasick
despite
the
close
foul
air
of
the
little
room
in
which
he
was
locked
he
still
heard
the
creaking
of
cordage
and
now
he
heard
the
tumbling
of
waves
too
indicating
that
the
weather
was
rough
he
tried
to
judge
by
these
sounds
how
fast
the
schooner
was
moving
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
then
he
strained
his
memory
to
see
if
he
could
discover
in
any
manner
how
long
he
had
been
on
the
vessel
but
the
period
of
his
unconsciousness
remained
a
mystery
which
he
could
not
unveil
by
a
single
second
long
stay
in
the
room
enabled
him
to
penetrate
its
dusk
a
little
and
he
saw
that
its
light
and
air
came
in
normal
times
from
a
single
small
porthole
closed
now
nevertheless
a
few
wisps
of
mist
entered
the
tiny
crevices
and
he
inferred
the
vessel
was
in
a
heavy
fog
he
was
glad
of
it
because
he
believed
the
schooner
would
move
slowly
at
such
a
time
and
anything
that
impeded
the
long
african
journey
was
to
his
advantage
a
period
which
seemed
to
be
six
hours
but
which
he
afterward
knew
to
be
only
one
passed
and
his
door
swung
back
for
the
third
time
the
face
of
miguel
appeared
in
the
opening
and
again
he
grinned
until
his
mouth
formed
a
mighty
slash
across
his
face
you
come
on
deck
now
you
peter
he
said
captain
wants
you
roberts
heart
gave
a
mighty
beat
only
those
who
have
been
shut
up
in
the
dark
know
what
it
is
to
come
out
into
the
light
that
alone
was
sufficient
to
give
him
a
fresh
store
of
courage
and
hope
so
he
followed
miguel
up
a
narrow
ladder
and
emerged
upon
the
deck
as
he
had
inferred
the
schooner
was
in
a
heavy
fog
with
scarcely
any
wind
and
the
sails
hanging
dead
the
captain
stood
near
the
mast
gazing
into
the
fog
he
looked
taller
and
more
evil
than
ever
and
robert
saw
the
outline
of
a
pistol
beneath
his
heavy
pea
jacket
several
other
men
of
various
nationalities
stood
about
the
deck
and
they
gave
robert
malicious
smiles
forward
he
saw
a
twelve
pound
brass
cannon
a
deadly
and
dangerous
looking
piece
it
was
extremely
cold
on
deck
too
the
raw
fog
seeming
to
be
so
much
liquid
ice
but
though
robert
shivered
he
liked
it
any
kind
of
fresh
air
was
heaven
after
that
stuffy
little
cabin
how
are
you
feeling
peter
asked
the
captain
although
there
was
no
note
of
sympathy
in
his
voice
very
well
sir
thank
you
replied
robert
and
again
i
wish
to
make
my
apologies
for
deserting
but
the
temptations
of
new
york
are
very
strong
sir
the
city
went
to
my
head
so
it
seems
we
missed
you
on
the
voyage
to
boston
and
back
but
we
have
you
now
doubtless
miguel
has
told
you
that
you
are
to
help
him
a
couple
of
days
in
his
galley
and
youll
stay
there
close
if
you
come
out
before
i
give
the
word
its
a
belaying
pin
for
you
but
when
i
do
give
the
word
youll
go
back
to
your
work
as
one
of
the
cleverest
sailormen
i
ever
had
youll
remember
how
you
used
to
go
out
on
the
spars
in
the
iciest
and
slipperiest
weather
none
so
clever
at
it
as
you
peter
and
ill
soon
see
that
you
have
the
chance
to
show
again
to
all
the
men
that
youre
the
best
sailor
aboard
ship
robert
shivered
mentally
he
divined
the
plan
of
this
villain
who
would
send
him
in
the
icy
rigging
to
sure
death
he
an
untrained
sailor
could
not
keep
his
footing
there
in
a
storm
and
it
could
be
said
that
it
was
an
accident
as
it
would
be
in
the
fulfilment
though
not
in
the
intent
but
he
divined
something
else
that
stopped
the
mental
shudder
and
that
gave
him
renewed
hope
why
should
the
captain
threaten
him
with
a
belaying
pin
if
he
did
not
stay
in
the
cooks
galley
for
two
days
to
roberts
mind
but
one
reason
appeared
and
it
was
the
fear
that
he
should
be
seen
on
deck
and
that
fear
existed
because
they
were
yet
close
to
land
it
was
all
so
clear
to
him
that
he
never
doubted
and
again
his
heart
leaped
he
was
bareheaded
but
he
touched
the
place
where
his
cap
brim
should
have
been
and
replied
ill
remember
captain
see
that
you
do
said
the
man
in
level
tones
instinct
nevertheless
with
hardness
and
cruelty
robert
touched
his
forehead
again
and
turned
away
with
miguel
descending
to
the
cooks
galley
resolved
upon
some
daring
trial
he
did
not
yet
know
what
here
the
portuguese
set
him
to
work
at
once
scouring
pots
and
kettles
and
pans
and
he
toiled
without
complaint
until
his
arms
ached
miguel
at
last
began
to
talk
he
seemed
to
suffer
from
the
lack
of
companionship
and
robert
divined
that
he
was
the
only
portuguese
on
board
good
helper
you
peter
he
said
it
no
light
job
to
cook
for
twenty
men
and
all
of
them
hungry
all
the
time
have
we
our
full
crew
on
board
miguel
yes
twenty
men
and
four
more
and
plenty
guns
plenty
powder
and
ball
fine
cannon
too
robert
judged
that
the
slaver
would
be
well
armed
and
well
manned
but
he
decided
to
ask
no
more
questions
at
present
fearing
to
arouse
the
suspicions
of
miguel
and
he
worked
on
with
shut
lips
the
portuguese
himself
talkedit
seemed
that
he
had
to
do
so
as
the
longing
for
companionship
overcame
himbut
he
did
not
tell
the
name
of
the
schooner
or
its
captain
he
merely
chattered
of
former
voyages
and
of
the
ports
he
had
been
in
invariably
addressing
his
helper
as
peter
and
speaking
of
him
as
if
he
had
been
his
comrade
robert
while
apparently
absorbed
in
his
tasks
listened
attentively
to
all
that
he
might
hear
from
above
he
knew
that
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
ever
and
that
the
ship
was
merely
moving
up
and
down
with
the
swells
she
might
be
anchored
in
comparatively
shallow
water
now
he
was
absolutely
sure
that
they
were
somewhere
near
the
coast
and
the
coast
meant
hope
and
a
chance
dinner
rude
but
plentiful
was
served
for
the
sailors
and
food
somewhat
more
delicate
for
the
captain
in
his
cabin
robert
himself
attended
to
the
captain
and
he
could
see
enough
now
to
know
that
the
dark
had
come
he
inferred
there
would
be
no
objection
to
his
going
upon
deck
in
the
night
but
he
made
no
such
suggestion
instead
he
waited
upon
the
tall
man
with
a
care
and
deftness
that
made
that
somber
master
grin
i
believe
absence
has
really
improved
you
peter
he
said
i
havent
been
waited
on
so
well
in
a
long
time
thank
you
sir
said
robert
secretly
he
was
burning
with
humiliation
it
hurt
his
pride
terribly
to
serve
a
rough
sea
captain
in
such
a
manner
but
he
had
no
choice
and
he
resolved
that
if
the
chance
came
he
would
pay
the
debt
when
the
dinner
or
supper
whichever
it
might
be
called
was
over
he
went
back
to
the
galley
and
cheerfully
began
to
clear
away
and
to
wash
and
wipe
dishes
miguel
gave
him
a
compliment
saying
that
he
had
improved
since
their
latest
voyage
and
robert
thanked
him
duly
when
all
the
work
was
done
he
crawled
into
a
bunk
just
over
the
cooks
and
in
any
other
situation
would
have
fallen
asleep
at
once
but
his
nerves
were
on
edge
and
he
was
not
sleepy
in
the
least
miguel
without
taking
off
his
clothes
lay
down
in
the
bunk
beneath
him
and
robert
soon
heard
him
snoring
he
also
heard
new
sounds
from
above
a
whistle
and
a
shriek
and
a
roar
combined
that
he
did
not
recognize
at
first
but
which
a
little
thought
told
him
to
be
a
growing
wind
and
the
crash
of
the
waves
the
schooner
began
to
dip
and
rise
violently
he
was
dizzy
for
a
little
while
but
he
soon
recovered
a
storm
the
knowledge
gave
him
pleasure
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
felt
that
it
too
contributed
hope
and
a
chance
the
roar
of
the
storm
increased
but
miguel
who
had
probably
spent
nearly
all
his
life
at
sea
continued
to
sleep
soundly
robert
was
never
in
his
life
more
thoroughly
awake
he
sat
up
in
his
bunk
and
now
and
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
of
footsteps
overhead
but
soon
they
were
lost
entirely
in
the
incessant
shrieking
of
the
wind
and
the
continuous
thunder
of
the
great
waves
against
the
side
of
the
schooner
in
truth
it
was
a
storm
one
of
great
fury
he
knew
that
the
ship
although
stripped
to
the
utmost
must
be
driving
fast
but
in
what
direction
he
had
no
idea
he
would
have
given
much
to
know
the
tumult
grew
and
by
and
by
he
heard
orders
shouted
through
a
trumpet
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
leaping
down
he
seized
the
portuguese
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
up
miguel
he
cried
a
great
storm
is
upon
us
the
cook
opened
his
eyes
sleepily
and
then
sprang
up
a
look
of
alarm
on
his
face
while
the
eyes
of
the
portuguese
were
filled
with
fear
he
also
seemed
to
be
in
a
daze
it
was
apparent
to
robert
that
he
was
a
heavy
sleeper
and
his
long
black
hair
falling
about
his
forehead
he
stared
wildly
his
aspect
made
an
appeal
to
roberts
sense
of
humor
even
in
those
tense
moments
my
judgment
tells
me
miguel
he
shoutedhe
was
compelled
to
raise
his
voice
to
a
high
pitch
owing
to
the
tremendous
clatter
overheadthat
there
is
a
great
storm
and
the
schooner
is
in
danger
and
you
know
too
that
your
old
comrade
peter
smith
who
has
sailed
the
seas
with
you
so
long
is
likely
to
be
right
in
his
opinions
the
gaze
of
miguel
became
less
wild
but
he
looked
at
robert
with
awe
and
then
with
superstition
you
have
brought
us
bad
luck
he
exclaimed
an
evil
day
for
us
when
you
came
aboard
robert
laughed
a
fanciful
humor
seized
him
but
this
is
my
place
he
said
i
peter
smith
belong
on
board
this
schooner
and
you
know
miguel
that
you
and
the
captain
insisted
on
my
coming
back
we
go
on
deck
cried
the
cook
now
thoroughly
alarmed
by
the
uproar
which
always
increased
he
rushed
up
the
ladder
and
robert
followed
him
to
be
blown
completely
off
his
feet
when
he
reached
the
deck
but
he
snatched
at
the
woodwork
held
fast
and
regained
an
upright
position
the
captain
stood
not
far
away
holding
to
a
rope
but
he
was
so
deeply
engrossed
in
directing
his
men
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
robert
the
youth
cleared
the
mist
and
spray
from
his
eyes
and
took
a
comprehensive
look
the
aspect
of
sea
and
sky
was
enough
to
strike
almost
any
one
with
terror
but
upon
this
occasion
he
was
an
exception
he
had
never
looked
upon
a
wilder
world
but
in
its
very
wildness
lay
his
hope
the
icy
spars
from
which
he
would
slip
to
plunge
to
his
death
in
the
chilling
sea
were
gone
and
so
was
far
africa
and
the
slavers
hunt
he
was
not
a
seaman
his
experience
had
been
with
lakes
but
one
could
reason
from
lakes
to
the
universal
ocean
and
he
knew
that
the
schooner
was
in
a
fight
for
life
and
involved
in
it
was
his
fight
for
freedom
the
wind
cold
as
death
and
sharp
as
a
sword
blew
out
of
the
northeast
and
the
schooner
heeled
far
over
was
driving
fast
before
it
in
spite
of
every
effort
of
a
capable
captain
and
crew
the
ship
rose
and
fell
violently
with
the
huge
swells
and
water
that
stung
like
an
icy
sleet
swept
over
her
continually
looking
to
the
westward
robert
saw
something
that
caused
his
heart
to
throb
violently
it
was
a
dim
low
line
but
he
knew
it
to
be
land
what
land
it
was
he
had
no
idea
nor
did
he
at
the
moment
care
but
there
lay
freedom
rows
of
breakers
opening
their
strong
teeth
for
the
ship
might
stretch
between
but
better
the
breakers
than
the
slavers
deck
and
the
man
hunt
in
the
slimy
african
lagoons
for
him
the
icy
wind
was
the
breath
of
life
and
he
soon
ceased
to
shiver
but
he
became
conscious
of
chattering
teeth
near
him
and
he
saw
miguel
his
face
a
reproduction
of
terror
in
all
its
aspects
we
go
shouted
the
portuguese
the
storm
drive
the
ship
on
the
breakers
and
she
break
to
pieces
and
all
of
us
lost
roberts
fantastic
spirit
was
again
strong
upon
him
then
let
us
go
he
shouted
back
better
this
clean
cold
coast
than
the
fever
swamps
of
africa
hold
fast
miguel
and
well
ride
in
together
the
superstitious
awe
of
the
portuguese
deepened
and
he
drew
away
from
robert
in
the
moment
of
terrible
storm
and
approaching
death
this
could
be
no
mortal
youth
who
showed
not
fear
but
instead
a
joy
that
was
near
to
exaltation
then
and
there
he
was
convinced
that
when
they
had
seized
him
and
brought
him
aboard
they
had
made
their
own
doom
certain
in
twenty
minutes
we
strike
cried
miguel
ah
how
the
wind
rise
many
a
year
since
i
see
such
a
storm
spars
snapped
and
were
carried
away
in
the
foaming
sea
then
the
mast
went
and
the
crew
began
to
launch
the
boats
robert
rushed
to
the
captains
cabin
when
he
served
the
man
there
he
had
not
failed
to
observe
what
the
room
contained
and
now
he
snatched
from
the
wall
a
huge
greatcoat
a
belt
containing
a
brace
of
pistols
in
a
holster
with
ammunition
and
a
small
sword
he
did
not
know
why
he
took
the
sword
but
it
was
probably
some
trick
of
the
fancy
and
he
buckled
it
on
with
the
rest
then
he
returned
to
the
deck
where
he
could
barely
hold
his
footing
the
schooner
had
heeled
so
far
over
and
so
powerful
was
the
wind
and
the
driving
of
the
spray
one
of
the
boats
had
been
launched
under
the
command
of
the
second
mate
but
she
was
overturned
almost
instantly
and
all
on
board
her
were
lost
robert
was
just
in
time
to
see
a
head
bob
once
or
twice
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
then
disappear
a
second
boat
commanded
by
the
first
mate
was
lowered
and
seven
or
eight
men
managed
to
get
into
it
rowing
with
all
their
might
toward
an
opening
that
appeared
in
the
white
line
of
foam
a
third
which
could
take
the
remainder
of
the
crew
was
made
ready
and
the
captain
himself
would
be
in
charge
of
it
it
was
launched
successfully
and
the
men
dropped
into
it
one
by
one
but
very
fast
miguel
swung
down
and
into
a
place
robert
advanced
for
the
same
purpose
but
the
captain
who
was
still
poised
on
the
rail
of
the
ship
took
notice
of
him
for
the
first
time
no
no
peter
he
shouted
and
even
in
the
roar
of
the
wind
robert
observed
the
grim
humor
in
his
voice
youve
been
a
good
and
faithful
sailorman
and
we
leave
you
in
charge
of
the
ship
its
a
great
promotion
and
honor
for
you
peter
but
you
deserve
it
handle
her
well
because
shes
a
good
schooner
and
answers
kindly
to
a
kind
hand
now
farewell
peter
and
a
long
and
happy
voyage
to
you
a
leveled
pistol
enforced
his
command
to
stop
and
the
next
moment
he
slid
down
a
rope
and
into
the
boat
a
sailor
cut
the
rope
and
they
pulled
quickly
away
leaving
robert
alone
on
the
schooner
his
exultation
turned
to
despair
for
a
moment
and
then
his
courage
came
back
tayoga
in
his
place
would
not
give
up
he
would
pray
to
his
manitou
who
was
roberts
god
and
put
complete
faith
in
his
wisdom
and
mercy
moreover
he
was
quit
of
all
that
hateful
crew
the
ship
of
the
slavers
was
beneath
his
feet
but
the
slavers
themselves
were
gone
as
he
looked
he
saw
the
second
boat
overturn
and
he
thought
he
heard
the
wild
cry
of
those
about
to
be
lost
but
he
felt
neither
pity
nor
sympathy
a
stern
god
stern
to
such
as
they
had
called
them
to
account
the
captains
boat
had
disappeared
in
the
mist
and
spray
robert
with
the
huge
greatcoat
wrapped
about
him
clung
to
the
stump
of
the
mast
which
long
since
had
been
blown
overboard
and
watched
the
white
line
of
the
breakers
rapidly
coming
nearer
as
they
reached
out
their
teeth
for
the
schooner
he
knew
that
he
could
do
nothing
more
for
himself
until
the
ship
struck
then
with
some
happy
chance
aiding
him
he
would
drop
into
the
sea
and
make
a
desperate
try
for
the
land
he
would
throw
off
the
greatcoat
when
he
leaped
but
meanwhile
he
kept
it
on
because
one
would
freeze
without
it
in
the
icy
wind
he
heard
presently
the
roaring
of
the
breakers
mingled
with
the
roaring
of
the
wind
and
shutting
his
eyes
he
prayed
for
a
miracle
he
felt
the
foam
beating
upon
his
face
and
believing
it
must
come
from
the
rocks
he
clung
with
all
his
might
to
the
stump
of
the
mast
because
the
shock
must
occur
within
a
few
moments
he
felt
the
schooner
shivering
under
him
and
rising
and
falling
heavily
and
then
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
where
best
to
leap
when
the
shock
did
come
he
beheld
the
thick
white
foam
to
right
and
left
but
he
had
not
prayed
in
vain
the
miracle
had
happened
here
was
a
narrow
opening
in
the
breakers
and
with
but
one
chance
in
a
hundred
to
guide
it
the
schooner
had
driven
directly
through
ceasing
almost
at
once
to
rock
so
violently
but
there
was
enough
power
left
in
the
waves
even
behind
the
rocks
to
send
the
schooner
upon
a
sandy
beach
where
she
must
soon
break
up
but
robert
was
saved
he
knew
it
and
he
murmured
devout
thanks
when
the
schooner
struck
in
the
sand
he
was
thrown
roughly
forward
but
he
managed
to
regain
his
feet
for
an
instant
and
he
leaped
outward
as
far
as
he
could
forgetting
to
take
off
his
greatcoat
a
returning
wave
threw
him
down
and
passed
over
his
head
but
exerting
all
his
will
and
all
his
strength
he
rose
when
it
had
passed
and
ran
for
the
land
as
hard
as
he
could
the
wave
returned
picked
him
up
and
hurried
him
on
his
way
when
it
started
back
again
its
force
was
too
much
spent
and
the
water
was
too
shallow
to
have
much
effect
on
robert
he
continued
running
through
the
yielding
sand
and
when
the
wave
came
in
again
and
snatched
at
him
it
was
not
able
to
touch
his
feet
he
reached
weeds
then
bushes
and
clutched
them
with
both
hands
lest
some
wave
higher
and
more
daring
than
all
the
rest
should
yet
come
for
him
and
seize
him
but
in
a
moment
he
let
them
go
knowing
that
he
was
safe
and
laughing
rather
giddily
sank
down
in
a
faint
chapter
xiii
the
meeting
when
robert
revived
the
wind
was
still
blowing
hard
although
there
had
been
some
decrease
in
its
violence
and
it
was
yet
night
he
was
wet
and
very
cold
and
as
he
arose
he
shivered
in
a
chill
the
greatcoat
was
still
wrapped
about
his
body
and
although
it
was
soaked
he
always
believed
nevertheless
that
in
some
measure
it
had
protected
him
while
he
slept
the
pistols
the
ammunition
and
the
sword
were
in
his
belt
and
he
believed
that
the
ammunition
fastened
securely
in
a
pouch
was
dry
though
he
would
look
into
that
later
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
not
been
unconscious
long
as
the
appearance
of
the
sky
was
unchanged
the
bushes
among
which
he
had
lain
were
short
but
tough
and
had
run
their
roots
down
deeply
into
the
sand
they
were
friendly
bushes
he
remembered
how
glad
he
had
been
to
grasp
them
when
he
made
that
run
from
the
surf
and
to
some
extent
they
had
protected
him
from
the
cold
wind
when
he
lay
among
them
like
one
dead
the
big
rollers
white
at
the
top
were
still
thundering
on
the
beach
and
directly
in
front
of
him
he
saw
a
lowering
hulk
that
of
the
schooner
the
slavers
wicked
days
were
done
as
every
wave
drove
it
deeper
into
the
sand
and
before
long
it
must
break
up
robert
felt
that
it
had
been
overtaken
by
retributive
justice
and
despite
the
chill
that
was
shaking
him
he
was
shaken
also
by
a
great
thrill
of
joy
wet
and
cold
and
on
a
desolate
shore
he
was
nevertheless
free
he
began
to
run
back
and
forth
with
great
vigor
until
he
felt
the
blood
flowing
in
a
warm
strong
current
through
his
veins
again
and
he
believed
that
in
time
his
clothes
would
dry
upon
him
he
took
off
the
greatcoat
and
hung
it
upon
the
bushes
where
the
wind
would
have
a
fair
chance
at
it
and
he
believed
that
in
the
morning
it
would
be
dry
too
then
finding
his
powder
untouched
by
the
water
he
withdrew
the
wet
charges
from
the
pistols
and
reloaded
them
if
he
had
not
been
seasoned
by
a
life
in
the
wilderness
and
countless
hardships
he
probably
would
have
perished
from
exhaustion
and
cold
but
his
strong
enduring
frame
threw
off
the
chill
and
he
did
not
pause
for
three
full
hours
until
he
had
made
a
successful
fight
for
his
life
then
very
tired
but
fairly
warm
he
stopped
for
a
while
and
became
conscious
that
the
wind
had
died
to
a
great
extent
the
rollers
were
not
half
so
high
and
the
hulk
of
the
ship
showed
larger
and
clearer
than
ever
he
believed
that
when
the
storm
ceased
he
could
board
her
and
find
food
if
he
did
not
find
it
elsewhere
meanwhile
he
would
explore
buckling
on
his
pistols
and
sword
but
leaving
the
greatcoat
to
continue
its
process
of
drying
he
walked
inland
finding
only
a
desolate
region
of
sand
bushes
and
salt
marshes
without
any
sign
of
human
habitation
he
believed
it
was
the
jersey
coast
and
that
he
could
not
be
any
vast
distance
from
new
york
but
it
seemed
hopeless
to
continue
in
that
direction
and
being
worn
to
the
bone
he
returned
to
his
greatcoat
which
had
become
almost
dry
in
the
wind
now
he
felt
that
he
must
address
himself
to
the
need
of
the
moment
which
was
sleep
and
he
hunted
a
long
time
for
a
suitable
lair
a
high
bank
of
sand
was
covered
with
bushes
larger
and
thicker
than
the
others
and
at
the
back
of
the
bank
grew
a
tree
of
considerable
size
with
two
spreading
roots
partly
above
ground
the
sand
was
quite
dry
and
he
heaped
it
much
higher
along
the
roots
then
he
lay
down
between
them
being
amply
protected
on
three
sides
while
the
bushes
waved
over
his
head
he
was
not
only
sheltered
he
was
hidden
also
and
feeling
safe
with
the
greatcoat
now
wholly
dry
wrapped
around
him
and
the
pistols
and
sword
beside
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
the
kindly
fortune
that
had
taken
the
lad
out
of
such
desperate
circumstances
remained
benevolent
the
wind
ceased
entirely
and
the
air
turned
much
warmer
day
soon
came
and
with
it
a
bright
cheerful
sun
that
gilded
the
great
expanse
of
low
and
desolate
shore
the
boy
slept
peacefully
while
the
morning
passed
and
the
high
sun
marked
the
coming
of
the
afternoon
he
had
been
asleep
about
ten
hours
when
he
awoke
turned
once
or
twice
in
his
lair
and
then
stood
up
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
striking
contrast
with
the
black
night
of
storm
and
he
knew
by
the
position
of
the
sun
that
it
was
within
about
three
hours
of
its
setting
he
tested
his
body
but
there
was
no
soreness
he
was
not
conscious
of
anything
but
a
ravening
hunger
and
he
believed
that
he
knew
where
he
could
satisfy
it
there
was
no
wind
and
the
sea
was
calm
save
for
a
slight
swell
the
schooner
its
prow
out
of
the
water
was
in
plain
view
it
was
so
deeply
imbedded
in
the
sand
that
robert
considered
it
a
firm
house
of
shelter
until
it
should
be
broken
to
pieces
by
successive
storms
but
at
present
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
storehouse
of
provisions
and
he
hurried
down
the
beach
his
foot
struck
against
something
and
he
stopped
shuddering
it
was
the
body
of
one
of
the
slavers
and
presently
he
passed
another
the
sea
was
giving
up
its
dead
he
reached
the
schooner
glad
to
leave
these
ghastly
objects
behind
him
and
with
some
difficulty
climbed
aboard
the
vessel
had
shipped
much
water
but
she
was
not
as
great
a
wreck
as
he
had
expected
and
he
instantly
descended
to
the
cooks
galley
where
he
had
given
his
brief
service
in
the
lockers
he
found
an
abundance
of
food
of
all
kinds
as
the
ship
had
been
equipped
for
a
long
voyage
and
he
ate
hungrily
though
sparingly
at
first
then
he
went
into
the
captains
cabin
lay
down
on
a
couch
and
took
a
long
and
luxurious
rest
robert
was
happy
he
felt
that
he
had
won
or
rather
that
providence
had
won
for
him
a
most
wonderful
victory
over
adverse
fate
his
brilliant
imagination
at
once
leaped
up
and
painted
all
things
in
vivid
colors
tayoga
willet
and
the
others
must
be
terribly
alarmed
about
him
as
they
had
full
right
to
be
but
he
would
soon
be
back
in
new
york
telling
them
of
his
marvelous
risk
and
adventure
then
he
deliberated
about
taking
a
supply
of
provisions
to
his
den
in
the
bushes
but
when
he
went
on
deck
the
sun
was
already
setting
and
it
was
becoming
so
cold
again
that
he
decided
to
remain
on
the
schooner
why
not
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
at
first
the
skies
were
perfectly
clear
and
he
did
not
think
there
was
any
danger
of
a
storm
he
rummaged
about
discovered
plenty
of
blankets
and
made
a
bed
for
himself
in
the
captains
cabin
finding
a
grim
humor
in
the
fact
that
he
should
take
that
sinister
mans
place
but
as
it
was
only
three
or
four
hours
since
he
had
awakened
he
was
not
at
all
sleepy
and
he
returned
to
the
deck
where
he
wrapped
his
treasure
the
huge
greatcoat
about
his
body
and
sat
and
watched
he
saw
the
big
red
sun
set
and
the
darkness
come
down
again
the
air
still
and
very
cold
but
he
was
snug
and
warm
and
bethought
himself
of
what
he
must
undertake
on
the
morrow
if
he
continued
inland
long
enough
he
would
surely
come
to
somebody
and
at
dawn
taking
an
ample
supply
of
provisions
he
would
start
that
purpose
settled
he
let
his
mind
rest
and
remained
in
a
luxurious
position
on
the
deck
the
rebound
from
the
hopeless
case
in
which
he
had
seemed
to
be
was
so
great
that
he
was
not
lonely
he
had
instead
a
wholly
pervading
sense
of
ease
and
security
his
imagination
was
able
to
find
beauty
in
the
sand
and
the
bushes
and
the
salt
marshes
and
he
did
not
need
imagination
at
all
to
discover
it
in
the
great
mysterious
ocean
which
the
moon
was
now
tinting
with
silver
it
was
a
fine
full
moon
shedding
its
largest
supply
of
beams
and
swarms
of
bright
stars
sparkled
in
the
cold
blue
skies
a
fine
night
thought
robert
suited
to
his
fine
future
it
was
very
late
when
he
went
down
to
the
captains
cabin
ate
a
little
more
food
and
turned
in
he
soon
slept
but
not
needing
sleep
much
now
he
awoke
at
dawn
his
awakening
may
have
been
hastened
by
the
footsteps
and
voices
he
heard
but
in
any
event
he
rose
softly
and
buckled
on
his
sword
and
pistols
one
of
the
voices
high
and
sharp
he
recognized
and
he
believed
that
once
more
he
was
the
child
of
good
fortune
because
he
had
been
awakened
in
time
he
sat
on
the
couch
facing
the
door
put
the
sword
by
his
side
and
held
one
of
the
pistols
cocked
and
resting
on
his
knee
the
footsteps
and
voices
came
nearer
and
then
the
keen
cruel
face
appeared
at
the
door
good
morning
captain
said
robert
equably
you
left
me
in
command
of
the
ship
and
i
did
my
best
with
her
i
couldnt
keep
her
afloat
and
so
i
ran
her
up
here
on
the
beach
where
as
you
see
she
is
still
habitable
youre
a
good
seaman
peter
said
the
captain
hiding
any
surprise
that
he
may
have
felt
but
you
havent
obeyed
my
orders
in
full
i
expected
you
to
keep
the
ship
afloat
and
you
havent
done
so
that
was
too
much
to
expect
i
see
that
you
have
two
men
with
you
tell
them
to
step
forward
where
i
can
cover
them
as
well
as
you
with
the
muzzle
of
this
pistol
thats
right
now
im
going
to
confide
in
you
go
ahead
peter
i
havent
liked
your
manner
for
a
long
time
captain
im
only
peter
smith
a
humble
seaman
but
since
you
left
me
in
command
of
the
ship
last
night
i
mean
to
keep
the
place
with
all
the
responsibilities
duties
and
honors
appertaining
to
it
take
your
hands
away
from
your
belt
this
is
a
lone
coast
and
im
the
law
the
judge
and
the
executioner
now
you
and
the
two
men
back
away
from
the
door
and
as
sure
as
theres
a
god
in
heaven
if
any
one
of
you
tries
to
draw
a
weapon
ill
shoot
him
youll
observe
that
ive
two
pistols
and
also
a
sword
a
sailor
engaged
in
a
hazardous
trade
like
ours
catching
and
selling
slaves
usually
learns
how
to
use
firearms
but
im
pretty
good
with
the
sword
too
captain
though
ive
hid
the
knowledge
from
you
before
now
just
kindly
back
into
the
cooks
galley
there
and
you
and
your
comrades
make
up
a
good
big
bag
of
food
for
me
ill
tell
you
what
to
choose
i
warn
you
a
second
time
to
keep
your
hands
away
from
your
belt
ill
really
have
to
shoot
off
a
finger
or
two
as
a
warning
if
you
dont
restrain
your
murderous
instincts
murder
is
always
a
bad
trade
captain
put
in
some
of
those
hard
biscuits
and
some
of
the
cured
meats
no
none
of
the
liquors
i
have
no
use
for
them
by
the
way
what
became
of
miguel
with
whom
i
worked
so
often
hes
drowned
replied
the
captain
im
sorry
said
robert
and
he
meant
it
miguel
was
the
only
one
on
board
the
slaver
who
had
shown
a
ray
of
human
sympathy
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
the
captain
his
face
contorted
with
rage
and
chagrin
first
ill
see
that
you
finish
filling
that
bag
as
i
direct
put
in
the
packages
yourself
i
like
to
watch
you
work
captain
its
good
for
you
and
after
you
fill
the
bag
and
pass
it
to
me
im
going
to
hand
the
ship
back
to
you
ive
never
really
liked
her
and
i
mean
to
resign
the
command
i
think
peter
smith
is
fit
for
better
things
so
you
intend
to
leave
the
schooner
yes
but
you
wont
see
me
do
it
pass
me
the
bag
now
be
careful
with
your
hands
in
truth
i
think
youd
better
raise
them
above
your
head
and
your
comrades
can
do
the
same
quick
up
with
them
or
i
shoot
thats
right
now
ill
back
away
im
going
up
the
ladder
backward
and
when
i
go
out
i
intend
to
shove
in
place
the
grating
that
covers
the
entrance
to
the
deck
there
you
can
escape
in
five
minutes
of
course
but
by
that
time
ill
be
off
the
ship
and
among
the
bushes
out
of
your
reach
oh
i
know
its
humiliating
captain
but
youve
had
your
way
a
long
time
and
the
slavers
trade
is
not
a
nice
one
the
ghosts
of
the
blacks
whom
you
have
caused
to
die
must
haunt
you
some
time
captain
and
since
your
schooner
is
lost
youll
now
have
a
chance
to
turn
to
a
better
business
for
the
last
time
i
tell
you
to
be
careful
with
your
hands
a
sailor
man
would
miss
his
fingers
he
backed
cautiously
until
his
heels
touched
the
ladder
meanwhile
watching
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
knew
that
the
captain
was
consumed
with
rage
but
angry
and
reckless
as
he
was
he
would
not
dare
to
reach
for
a
weapon
of
his
own
while
the
pistol
confronting
him
was
held
with
such
a
steady
hand
he
also
listened
for
sounds
made
by
other
men
on
the
ship
but
heard
none
then
he
began
to
back
slowly
up
the
stairway
continuing
his
running
address
i
know
that
your
arms
must
be
growing
weary
captain
he
said
and
he
enjoyed
it
as
he
said
it
but
you
wont
have
to
keep
em
up
much
longer
two
more
steps
will
take
me
out
upon
the
deck
and
then
youll
be
free
to
do
as
you
please
it
was
the
last
two
steps
that
troubled
him
most
in
order
to
keep
the
men
covered
with
the
pistol
he
had
to
bend
far
down
and
he
knew
that
when
he
could
no
longer
bend
far
enough
the
danger
would
come
but
he
solved
it
by
straightening
up
suddenly
and
taking
two
steps
at
a
leap
he
heard
shouts
and
oaths
and
the
report
of
a
pistol
but
the
bullet
was
as
futile
as
the
cries
he
slammed
down
the
grating
fastened
it
in
an
instant
ran
to
the
low
rail
and
swiftly
lowered
himself
and
his
pack
over
it
and
into
the
sand
then
he
ran
for
the
bushes
robert
did
not
waste
his
breath
having
managed
the
affair
of
the
grating
he
knew
that
he
was
safe
for
the
present
so
when
he
reached
the
higher
bushes
he
stopped
well
hidden
by
them
and
looked
back
in
two
or
three
minutes
the
captain
and
the
two
men
appeared
on
the
deck
and
he
laughed
quietly
to
himself
he
could
see
that
their
faces
were
contorted
by
rage
they
could
follow
his
trail
some
distance
at
least
in
the
sand
but
he
knew
that
they
would
be
cautious
he
had
shown
them
his
quality
and
they
would
fear
an
ambush
he
was
justified
in
his
opinion
as
they
remained
on
the
deck
evidently
searching
for
a
glimpse
of
him
among
the
bushes
and
after
watching
them
a
little
while
he
set
out
inland
bearing
his
burden
of
weapons
and
food
and
laughing
to
himself
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
made
the
captain
serve
him
he
felt
now
that
the
score
between
them
was
even
and
he
was
willing
to
part
company
forever
youth
and
success
had
an
enormous
effect
upon
him
when
one
triumph
was
achieved
his
vivid
temperament
always
foresaw
others
willet
had
often
called
him
the
child
of
hope
and
hope
is
a
powerful
factor
in
victory
now
it
seemed
to
him
for
a
little
while
that
his
own
rescue
achieved
by
himself
was
complete
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
return
to
new
york
and
his
friends
and
that
was
just
detail
he
swung
along
through
the
bushes
forgetting
the
burden
of
his
weapons
and
his
pack
of
food
in
truth
he
swaggered
a
bit
but
it
was
a
gay
and
gallant
swagger
and
it
became
him
he
walked
for
some
distance
feeling
that
he
had
been
changed
from
a
seaman
into
a
warrior
and
then
from
a
warrior
into
an
explorer
which
was
his
present
character
but
he
did
not
see
at
present
the
variety
and
majesty
that
all
explorers
wish
to
find
the
country
continued
low
the
same
alternation
of
sand
and
salt
marsh
although
the
bushes
were
increasing
in
size
and
they
were
interspersed
here
and
there
with
trees
of
some
height
reaching
the
crest
of
a
low
hill
he
took
his
last
look
backward
and
was
barely
able
to
see
the
upper
works
of
the
stranded
schooner
then
he
thought
of
the
captain
and
his
exuberant
spirits
compelled
him
to
laugh
aloud
with
the
chances
a
hundred
to
one
against
him
he
had
evened
the
score
while
he
had
been
compelled
to
serve
the
captain
the
captain
in
turn
had
been
forced
to
serve
him
it
was
enough
to
make
a
sick
man
well
and
to
turn
despair
into
confidence
he
was
in
very
truth
and
essence
the
child
of
hope
another
low
hill
and
from
its
summit
he
saw
nothing
but
the
bushy
wilderness
with
a
strip
of
forest
appearing
on
the
sunken
horizon
he
searched
the
sky
for
a
wisp
of
smoke
that
might
tell
of
a
human
habitation
below
but
saw
none
yet
people
might
live
beyond
the
strip
of
forest
where
the
land
would
be
less
sandy
and
more
fertile
and
after
a
brief
rest
he
pushed
on
with
the
same
vigor
of
the
body
and
elation
of
the
spirit
coming
soon
to
firmer
ground
of
which
he
was
glad
as
he
now
left
no
trail
at
least
none
that
an
ordinary
white
man
could
follow
he
trudged
bravely
on
for
hours
through
a
wilderness
that
seemed
to
be
complete
so
far
as
man
was
concerned
although
its
character
steadily
changed
merging
into
a
region
of
forest
and
good
soil
when
he
came
into
a
real
wood
of
trees
large
and
many
it
was
about
noon
and
finding
a
comfortable
place
with
his
back
to
a
tree
he
ate
from
the
precious
pack
the
day
was
still
brilliant
but
cold
and
he
wisely
kept
himself
thoroughly
wrapped
in
the
greatcoat
as
he
ate
he
saw
a
large
black
bear
walk
leisurely
through
the
forest
look
at
him
a
moment
or
two
and
then
waddle
on
in
the
same
grave
unalarmed
manner
the
incident
troubled
robert
and
his
high
spirits
came
down
a
notch
or
two
if
a
black
bear
cared
so
little
for
the
presence
of
an
armed
human
being
then
he
could
not
be
as
near
to
new
york
as
he
had
thought
perhaps
he
had
been
unconscious
on
the
schooner
a
long
time
he
felt
of
the
lump
which
was
not
yet
wholly
gone
from
his
head
and
tried
his
best
to
tell
how
old
it
was
but
he
could
not
do
it
the
little
cloud
in
his
golden
sky
disappeared
when
he
rose
and
started
again
through
a
fine
forest
his
spirits
became
as
high
as
ever
looking
westward
he
saw
the
dim
blue
line
of
distant
hills
and
he
turned
northward
inferring
that
new
york
must
lie
in
that
direction
in
two
hours
his
progress
was
barred
by
a
river
running
swiftly
between
high
banks
and
with
ice
at
the
edges
he
could
have
waded
it
as
the
water
would
not
rise
past
his
waist
but
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
chill
current
and
he
did
not
want
another
wetting
on
a
winter
day
he
followed
the
stream
a
long
distance
until
he
came
to
shallows
where
he
was
able
to
cross
it
on
stones
his
search
for
a
dry
ford
had
caused
much
delay
but
he
drew
comfort
from
his
observation
that
the
stones
making
his
pathway
through
the
water
were
large
and
almost
round
he
had
seen
many
such
about
new
york
and
he
had
often
marveled
at
their
smoothness
and
roundness
although
he
did
not
yet
know
the
geological
reason
but
the
stones
in
the
river
seemed
to
him
to
be
close
kin
to
the
stones
about
new
york
and
he
inferred
or
at
least
he
hoped
that
it
indicated
the
proximity
of
the
city
but
he
believed
that
he
would
have
to
spend
another
night
in
the
wilderness
search
the
sky
as
he
would
and
he
often
did
there
was
no
trace
of
smoke
and
as
the
sun
went
down
the
zenith
and
the
cold
began
to
increase
his
spirits
fell
a
little
but
he
reasoned
with
himself
why
should
one
inured
as
he
was
to
the
forest
and
winter
armed
provisioned
and
equipped
with
the
greatcoat
be
troubled
the
answer
to
his
question
was
a
return
of
confidence
in
full
tide
and
resolving
to
be
leisurely
he
looked
about
in
the
woods
for
his
new
camp
what
he
wanted
was
an
abundance
of
dead
leaves
out
of
which
to
make
a
nest
dead
leaves
were
cold
to
the
touch
but
they
would
serve
as
a
couch
and
a
wall
shutting
out
further
cold
from
the
earth
and
from
the
outside
air
and
with
the
greatcoat
between
he
would
be
warm
enough
he
would
have
nothing
to
fear
except
snow
and
the
skies
gave
no
promise
of
that
danger
he
found
the
leaves
in
a
suitable
hollow
and
disposed
them
according
to
his
plan
the
whole
making
a
comfortable
place
for
a
seasoned
forester
and
while
he
ate
his
supper
he
watched
the
sun
set
over
the
wilderness
long
after
it
was
gone
he
saw
the
stars
come
out
and
then
he
looked
at
the
particular
one
on
which
tododaho
tayogas
patron
saint
had
been
living
more
than
four
hundred
years
it
was
glittering
in
uncommon
splendor
save
for
a
slight
mist
across
its
face
which
must
be
the
snakes
in
the
hair
of
the
great
onondaga
chieftain
who
he
felt
was
watching
over
him
because
he
was
the
friend
of
tayoga
then
he
fell
asleep
sleeping
soundly
all
through
the
night
and
although
he
was
a
little
stiff
in
the
morning
a
few
minutes
of
exercise
relieved
him
of
it
and
he
ate
his
breakfast
his
journey
toward
the
north
was
resumed
and
in
an
hour
he
emerged
into
a
little
valley
to
come
almost
face
to
face
with
the
captain
and
the
two
sailors
they
were
sitting
on
a
log
apparently
weary
and
at
a
loss
but
they
rose
quickly
at
his
coming
and
the
captains
hand
slid
down
to
his
pistol
roberts
slid
to
his
making
about
the
same
speed
although
his
heart
pounded
a
moment
or
two
at
first
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
soon
he
became
calm
it
was
perhaps
because
he
had
been
through
so
many
dangers
that
one
more
did
not
count
for
much
you
see
captain
he
said
that
neither
has
the
advantage
of
the
other
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
here
or
in
truth
anywhere
else
i
left
you
in
command
of
the
schooner
and
you
have
deserted
your
post
when
i
held
that
position
i
remained
true
to
my
duty
the
captain
who
was
heavily
armed
carrying
a
cutlass
as
well
as
pistols
smiled
sourly
youre
a
lad
of
spirit
peter
he
said
ive
always
given
you
credit
for
that
in
my
way
i
like
you
and
i
think
ill
have
you
to
go
along
with
us
again
i
couldnt
think
of
it
we
must
part
company
forever
we
did
it
once
but
perhaps
the
second
time
will
count
no
my
crew
is
now
reduced
to
twothe
ocean
has
all
the
othersand
i
need
your
help
it
would
be
better
anyway
for
you
to
come
along
with
us
this
acadia
is
a
desolate
coast
there
was
a
log
opposite
the
one
upon
which
they
had
been
sitting
and
robert
took
his
place
upon
it
easily
not
to
say
confidently
he
felt
sure
that
they
would
not
fire
upon
him
now
having
perhaps
nothing
to
gain
by
it
but
he
kept
a
calculating
eye
upon
them
nevertheless
and
so
this
is
acadia
he
said
ive
been
wondering
what
land
it
might
be
i
did
not
know
that
we
had
come
so
far
acadia
is
a
long
way
from
new
york
a
long
long
way
peter
but
you
know
the
coast
well
of
course
captain
of
course
ive
made
several
voyages
in
the
neighboring
waters
theres
only
one
settlement
within
fifty
miles
of
us
and
youd
never
find
it
its
so
small
and
the
wilderness
is
such
a
maze
the
country
does
look
like
much
of
a
puzzle
but
ive
concluded
captain
that
i
wont
go
with
you
why
not
im
persuaded
that
youre
the
very
prince
of
liars
and
in
your
company
my
morals
might
be
contaminated
the
mans
face
was
too
tanned
to
flush
but
his
eyes
sparkled
youre
over
loose
with
words
lad
he
said
and
its
an
expensive
habit
i
can
afford
it
i
know
as
surely
as
were
sitting
here
facing
each
other
that
this
is
not
the
coast
of
acadia
then
what
coast
is
it
that
i
know
not
but
taking
the
time
i
mean
to
have
i
shall
find
out
then
ill
tell
you
if
you
wish
to
know
where
shall
i
deliver
my
message
i
think
youre
insolent
i
say
again
that
its
the
coast
of
acadia
and
youre
going
with
us
were
three
to
your
one
and
youll
have
to
do
as
i
say
robert
turned
his
gaze
from
the
captain
to
his
two
men
while
their
faces
were
far
from
good
they
showed
no
decision
of
character
he
knew
at
once
that
they
belonged
to
the
large
class
of
men
who
are
always
led
both
carried
pistols
but
he
did
not
think
it
likely
that
they
would
attempt
to
use
them
unless
the
captain
did
so
first
his
gaze
came
back
to
the
tall
man
and
observing
again
the
heavy
cutlass
he
carried
a
thought
leaped
up
in
his
mind
you
wish
me
to
go
with
you
he
said
and
i
dont
wish
to
go
which
leaves
it
an
open
question
its
best
to
decide
it
in
clean
and
decisive
fashion
and
i
suggest
that
we
leave
it
to
your
cutlass
and
my
sword
the
closeset
eyes
of
the
captain
gleamed
i
dont
want
to
kill
you
but
to
take
you
back
alive
he
said
you
were
always
a
strong
and
handy
lad
peter
and
i
need
your
help
you
wont
kill
me
that
i
promise
you
you
havent
a
chance
on
earth
you
pledge
your
word
that
your
men
will
not
interfere
while
the
combat
is
in
progress
nor
will
they
do
so
afterward
if
i
win
they
will
not
stir
remain
where
you
are
lads
the
two
sailors
settled
themselves
back
comfortably
clasping
their
knees
with
their
hands
and
robert
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
their
confidence
in
the
captains
prowess
and
easy
victory
was
sufficient
assurance
they
were
not
to
be
blamed
for
the
belief
as
their
leaders
cutlass
was
heavy
and
his
opponent
was
only
a
youth
the
captain
was
of
the
same
opinion
and
his
mood
became
light
and
gay
i
dont
intend
to
kill
you
peter
he
said
but
a
goodly
cut
or
two
will
let
out
some
of
your
impertinent
blood
thanks
captain
for
so
much
saving
grace
because
i
like
to
live
i
make
you
the
same
promise
i
dont
want
your
death
on
my
hands
but
there
is
poison
in
the
veins
of
a
man
who
is
willing
to
be
a
slaver
i
will
let
it
out
in
order
that
its
place
may
be
taken
by
pure
and
wholesome
blood
the
captain
frowned
and
made
a
few
swings
with
his
cutlass
then
he
ran
a
finger
along
its
keen
edge
and
he
felt
satisfied
with
himself
a
vast
amount
of
rage
and
mortification
was
confined
in
his
system
and
not
charging
any
of
it
to
the
storm
the
full
volume
of
his
anger
was
directed
against
his
cooks
former
assistant
peter
smith
who
was
entirely
too
jaunty
and
independent
in
his
manner
he
could
not
understand
roberts
presumption
in
challenging
him
to
a
combat
with
swords
but
he
would
punish
him
cruelly
while
the
two
sailors
looked
on
and
saw
it
well
done
robert
put
his
pack
his
greatcoat
his
coat
and
his
belt
with
the
pistols
and
ammunition
in
a
heap
and
looked
carefully
to
the
sword
that
he
had
taken
from
the
captains
cabin
it
was
a
fine
weapon
though
much
lighter
than
the
cutlass
he
bent
the
blade
a
little
and
then
made
it
whistle
in
curves
about
his
head
he
had
a
purpose
in
doing
so
and
it
was
attained
at
once
the
captain
looked
at
him
with
rising
curiosity
peter
he
said
you
dont
seem
to
be
wholly
unfamiliar
with
the
sword
and
you
nothing
but
a
cooks
helper
its
true
captain
the
hilt
fits
lovingly
into
my
hand
in
my
spare
moments
and
when
nobody
was
looking
ive
often
stolen
this
sword
of
yours
from
the
cabin
and
practiced
with
it
i
mean
now
to
make
you
feel
the
result
of
that
practice
the
captain
gazed
at
him
doubtfully
but
in
a
moment
or
two
the
confident
smile
returned
to
his
eyes
it
was
not
possible
that
a
mere
stripling
could
stand
before
him
and
his
cutlass
but
he
took
off
his
own
coat
which
he
had
believed
hitherto
was
a
useless
precaution
there
was
a
level
space
about
thirty
feet
across
and
robert
sword
in
hand
advanced
toward
the
center
of
it
he
had
already
chosen
his
course
which
would
be
psychological
as
well
as
physical
he
intended
that
the
battle
should
play
upon
the
slavers
mind
as
well
as
upon
his
body
im
ready
captain
he
said
dont
keep
us
waiting
its
winter
as
you
well
know
and
well
both
grow
cold
standing
here
in
weather
like
this
we
need
work
quick
and
warm
the
angry
blood
surged
into
the
captains
face
although
it
did
not
show
through
his
tan
but
he
made
an
impatient
movement
and
stepped
forward
hastily
it
cant
be
told
of
me
that
i
kept
a
lad
waiting
he
said
ill
warrant
you
youll
soon
be
warm
enough
then
were
both
well
suited
captain
and
it
should
be
a
fine
passage
at
arms
the
two
sailors
sitting
on
the
log
looked
at
each
other
and
chuckled
it
was
evident
to
robert
that
they
had
supreme
confidence
in
the
captain
and
expected
to
see
peter
smith
receive
a
lesson
that
would
put
him
permanently
in
his
place
the
mutual
look
and
the
mutual
chuckle
aroused
some
anger
in
robert
but
did
not
impair
his
certainty
of
victory
nevertheless
he
neglected
no
precaution
the
captain
advanced
holding
the
heavy
cutlass
with
ease
and
lightness
he
was
a
tall
and
very
strong
man
and
robert
noted
the
look
of
cruelty
in
the
closeset
eyes
he
knew
what
he
must
expect
in
case
of
defeat
and
again
telling
himself
to
be
careful
he
recalled
all
the
cunning
that
willet
had
taught
him
are
you
ready
he
asked
quietly
aye
peter
and
your
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
is
upon
you
again
the
two
sailors
on
the
log
looked
at
each
other
and
chuckled
i
dont
think
so
captain
said
robert
perhaps
the
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
is
yours
he
stared
straight
into
the
closeset
cruel
eyes
so
fixedly
and
so
long
that
the
captain
lowered
his
gaze
proving
that
the
superior
strength
of
will
lay
with
his
younger
opponent
then
he
shook
himself
angrily
his
temper
stirred
because
his
eyes
had
given
way
begin
said
robert
the
captain
slashed
with
the
heavy
cutlass
and
robert
easily
turned
aside
the
blow
with
his
lighter
weapon
he
saw
then
that
the
captain
was
no
swordsman
in
the
true
sense
and
he
believed
he
had
nothing
to
fear
he
waited
until
the
man
attacked
again
and
again
he
deftly
turned
aside
the
blow
the
two
sailors
sitting
on
the
log
looked
at
each
other
once
more
but
they
did
not
chuckle
robert
still
watching
the
closeset
cruel
eyes
saw
a
look
of
doubt
appear
there
my
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
seems
to
be
delayed
captain
he
said
with
irony
the
man
stung
beyond
endurance
attacked
with
fury
the
heavy
cutlass
singing
and
whistling
as
he
slashed
and
thrust
robert
contented
himself
with
the
defense
giving
ground
slowly
and
moving
about
in
a
circle
the
captains
eye
at
first
glittered
with
a
triumphant
light
as
he
saw
his
foe
retreat
and
the
two
sailors
sitting
on
the
log
and
exchanging
looks
found
cause
to
chuckle
once
more
but
the
light
sank
as
they
completed
the
circle
leaving
robert
untouched
and
breathing
as
easily
as
ever
while
the
captain
was
panting
now
he
decided
that
his
own
time
had
come
and
knowing
that
the
combat
was
mental
as
well
as
physical
he
taunted
his
opponent
in
truth
captain
he
said
my
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
did
not
arrive
but
yours
i
think
is
coming
look
look
see
the
red
spot
on
your
waistcoat
despite
himself
the
captain
looked
down
the
sword
flickered
in
like
lightning
and
then
flashed
away
again
but
when
it
was
gone
the
red
spot
on
the
waistcoat
was
there
his
flesh
stung
with
a
slight
wound
but
the
wound
to
his
spirit
was
deeper
he
rushed
in
and
slashed
recklessly
have
a
care
captain
cried
robert
you
are
fencing
very
wildly
i
tell
you
again
that
your
play
with
the
cutlass
is
bad
you
cant
see
it
but
there
is
now
a
red
spot
on
your
cheek
to
match
the
one
on
your
waistcoat
his
sword
darted
by
the
others
guard
and
when
it
came
away
its
point
was
red
with
blood
a
deep
and
dripping
gash
in
the
captains
left
cheek
showed
where
it
had
passed
the
two
sailors
sitting
on
the
log
exchanged
looks
once
more
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
chuckle
thats
for
being
a
slaver
captain
said
robert
its
a
bad
occupation
and
you
ought
to
quit
it
but
your
wound
will
leave
a
scar
and
you
will
not
like
to
say
that
it
was
made
by
one
whom
you
kidnapped
and
undertook
to
carry
away
to
his
death
the
captain
in
a
long
career
of
crime
and
cruelty
had
met
with
but
few
checks
and
to
experience
one
now
from
the
hands
of
a
lad
was
bitter
beyond
endurance
the
sting
was
all
the
greater
because
of
his
knowledge
that
the
two
sailors
who
still
exchanged
looks
but
no
chuckles
were
witnesses
of
it
the
blood
falling
from
his
left
cheek
stained
his
left
shoulder
and
he
was
a
gruesome
sight
he
rushed
in
again
mad
with
anger
worse
and
worse
captain
said
his
young
opponent
youre
not
showing
a
single
quality
of
a
swordsman
youve
nothing
but
strength
i
bade
you
have
a
care
now
your
right
cheek
is
a
match
for
your
left
the
captain
uttered
a
cry
drawn
as
much
by
anger
as
by
pain
the
deep
point
of
his
opponents
sword
had
passed
across
his
right
cheek
and
the
red
drops
fell
on
both
shoulders
the
two
sailors
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
the
man
paused
for
breath
and
he
was
a
ghastly
sight
i
told
you
more
than
once
to
beware
captain
said
robert
but
you
would
not
heed
me
your
temper
has
been
spoiled
by
success
but
in
time
nearly
every
slaver
meets
his
punishment
im
grateful
that
its
been
permitted
to
me
to
inflict
upon
you
a
little
of
all
thats
owing
to
you
wounds
in
the
face
are
very
painful
and
they
leave
scars
as
youll
learn
he
had
already
decided
upon
his
finishing
stroke
and
his
taunts
were
meant
to
push
the
captain
into
further
reckless
action
they
were
wholly
successful
as
the
man
sprang
forward
and
slashed
almost
at
random
now
robert
light
of
foot
and
agile
danced
before
him
like
a
fencing
master
the
captain
cut
and
thrust
at
the
flitting
form
but
always
it
danced
away
and
the
heavy
slashes
of
his
cutlass
cut
the
empty
air
his
dripping
wounds
and
his
vain
anger
making
him
weaker
and
weaker
but
he
would
not
stop
losing
all
control
of
his
temper
he
rushed
continually
at
his
opponent
the
two
sailors
looked
once
more
at
each
other
half
rose
to
their
feet
but
sat
down
again
and
were
silent
now
the
captain
saw
a
flash
of
light
before
him
and
he
felt
a
darting
pain
across
his
brow
as
the
keen
point
of
the
sword
passed
there
the
blood
ran
down
into
his
eyes
blinding
him
for
the
time
he
could
not
see
the
figure
before
him
but
he
knew
that
it
was
tense
and
waiting
he
groped
with
his
cutlass
but
touching
only
thin
air
he
threw
it
away
and
clapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
to
keep
away
the
trickling
blood
youll
have
three
scars
captain
came
the
maddening
voice
one
on
each
cheek
and
one
on
the
forehead
its
not
enough
punishment
for
a
slaver
but
in
truth
its
something
and
now
im
going
you
cant
see
to
follow
me
or
even
to
take
care
of
yourself
but
i
leave
you
in
the
hands
of
your
two
sailors
robert
put
on
his
coat
and
greatcoat
resumed
all
his
weapons
and
his
pack
and
turned
away
the
sailors
were
still
sitting
on
the
log
gazing
at
each
other
in
amazement
and
awe
neither
had
spoken
throughout
the
duel
nor
did
they
speak
now
the
victor
did
not
look
back
but
walked
swiftly
toward
the
north
glad
that
he
had
been
the
instrument
in
the
hands
of
fate
to
give
to
the
slaver
at
least
a
part
of
the
punishment
due
him
he
kept
steadily
on
several
hours
until
he
saw
a
smoke
on
the
western
sky
when
he
changed
his
course
and
came
in
another
half
hour
to
a
small
log
house
from
which
the
smoke
arose
a
man
standing
on
the
wooden
step
looked
at
him
with
all
the
curiosity
to
which
he
had
a
right
friend
said
robert
how
far
is
it
to
new
york
about
ten
miles
and
this
is
not
the
coast
of
acadia
acadia
what
country
is
that
i
never
heard
of
it
it
exists
but
never
mind
and
new
york
is
so
near
tell
me
that
distance
again
i
like
to
hear
it
ten
miles
stranger
when
you
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
there
you
can
see
the
houses
of
paulus
hook
robert
felt
a
great
sense
of
elation
and
then
of
thankfulness
while
fortune
had
been
cruel
in
putting
him
into
the
hands
of
the
slaver
it
had
relented
and
had
taken
him
out
of
them
when
the
chance
of
escape
seemed
none
stranger
said
the
man
you
look
grateful
about
something
i
am
i
have
cause
to
be
grateful
im
grateful
that
i
have
my
life
im
grateful
that
i
have
no
wounds
and
im
grateful
that
from
the
top
of
the
hill
there
i
shall
be
able
to
see
the
houses
of
paulus
hook
and
i
say
also
that
yours
is
the
kindliest
and
most
welcome
face
ive
looked
upon
in
many
a
day
farewell
farewell
said
the
man
staring
after
him
two
hours
later
robert
was
being
rowed
across
the
hudson
by
a
stalwart
waterman
as
he
passed
by
the
spot
where
his
boat
had
been
cut
down
by
the
schooner
he
took
off
his
hat
why
do
you
do
that
asked
the
waterman
because
at
this
spot
my
life
was
in
great
peril
a
few
days
ago
or
rather
here
started
the
peril
from
which
i
have
been
delivered
most
mercifully
an
hour
later
he
stood
on
the
solid
stone
doorstep
of
master
benjamin
hardy
important
ship
owner
merchant
and
financier
the
whimsical
fancy
that
so
often
turned
his
troubles
and
hardships
into
little
things
seized
robert
again
he
adjusted
carefully
his
somewhat
bedraggled
clothing
set
the
sword
and
pistols
in
his
belt
at
a
rakish
slant
put
the
pack
on
the
step
beside
him
and
lifting
the
heavy
brass
knocker
struck
loudly
he
heard
presently
the
sound
of
footsteps
inside
and
master
jonathan
pillsbury
looking
thinner
and
sadder
than
ever
threw
open
the
door
when
he
saw
who
was
standing
before
him
he
stared
and
stared
body
o
me
he
cried
at
last
throwing
up
his
hands
is
it
mr
lennox
or
his
ghost
its
mr
lennox
and
no
ghost
said
robert
briskly
let
me
in
mr
pillsbury
ive
grown
cold
standing
here
on
the
steps
are
you
sure
youre
no
ghost
quite
sure
here
pinch
me
on
the
arm
and
see
that
im
substantial
flesh
not
quite
so
hard
you
neednt
take
out
a
piece
are
you
satisfied
now
more
than
satisfied
mr
lennox
im
delighted
overjoyed
we
feared
that
you
were
dead
where
have
you
been
ive
been
serving
on
board
a
slaver
on
the
guinea
coast
thats
a
long
distance
from
here
and
it
was
an
exciting
life
but
im
back
again
safe
and
sound
master
jonathan
i
dont
understand
you
you
jest
mr
lennox
and
so
i
do
but
i
tell
you
master
jonathan
im
glad
to
be
back
again
you
dont
know
how
glad
do
you
hear
me
master
jonathan
the
sight
of
you
is
as
welcome
as
that
of
an
angel
the
air
grew
black
before
him
and
he
reeled
and
would
have
fallen
but
the
strong
arm
of
jonathan
pillsbury
caught
him
in
a
moment
or
two
his
eyes
cleared
and
he
became
steady
it
was
not
altogether
a
pleasure
voyage
of
yours
said
master
jonathan
dryly
no
mr
pillsbury
it
wasnt
but
i
came
near
fainting
then
because
i
was
so
glad
to
see
you
is
mr
hardy
here
no
he
has
gone
to
the
royal
exchange
he
has
been
nigh
prostrated
with
grief
but
i
persuaded
him
that
business
might
lighten
it
a
little
and
he
went
out
today
for
the
first
time
oh
young
sir
he
will
be
truly
delighted
to
find
that
you
have
come
back
safely
because
although
you
may
know
it
not
he
has
a
strong
affection
for
you
and
i
have
a
high
regard
for
him
master
jonathan
he
has
been
most
kind
to
me
come
in
mr
lennox
sit
down
in
the
drawingroom
and
rest
yourself
while
i
hurry
forth
with
the
welcome
news
robert
saw
that
his
prim
and
elderly
heart
was
in
truth
rejoiced
and
his
own
heart
warmed
in
turn
obscure
and
of
unknown
origin
though
he
might
be
friends
were
continually
appearing
for
him
everywhere
a
servant
took
his
weapons
and
what
was
left
of
his
pack
master
jonathan
insisted
upon
his
drinking
a
small
glass
of
wine
to
refresh
himself
and
then
he
was
left
alone
in
the
imposing
drawingroom
of
mr
hardy
he
sank
back
in
a
deep
chair
of
spanish
leather
and
shutting
his
eyes
took
several
long
breaths
of
relief
he
had
come
back
safely
and
his
escape
seemed
marvelous
even
to
himself
as
he
opened
his
eyes
a
mild
voice
said
and
so
dagaeoga
who
went
no
one
knows
where
has
returned
no
one
knows
how
tayoga
smiling
but
grave
and
looking
taller
and
more
majestic
than
ever
stood
before
him
aye
im
back
and
right
glad
i
am
to
be
here
exclaimed
robert
springing
to
his
feet
and
seizing
tayogas
hand
oh
ive
been
on
a
long
voyage
tayoga
ive
been
to
the
coast
of
africa
on
a
slaver
though
we
caught
no
slaves
and
i
was
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
acadia
and
i
fought
and
walked
my
way
back
to
new
york
but
its
a
long
tale
and
ill
not
tell
it
till
all
of
you
are
together
i
hope
you
were
not
too
much
alarmed
about
me
tayoga
i
know
that
dagaeoga
is
in
the
keeping
of
manitou
i
have
seen
too
many
proofs
of
it
to
doubt
i
was
sure
that
at
the
right
time
he
would
return
mr
hardy
came
presently
and
then
willet
they
made
no
display
of
emotion
but
their
joy
was
deep
then
robert
told
his
story
to
them
all
did
you
see
any
name
on
the
wrecked
schooner
asked
mr
hardy
none
at
all
replied
robert
if
she
had
borne
a
name
at
any
time
im
sure
it
was
painted
out
nor
did
you
hear
the
captain
called
by
name
either
no
sir
it
was
always
just
captain
when
the
men
addressed
him
that
complicates
our
problem
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
you
were
the
intended
victim
of
a
conspiracy
from
which
you
were
saved
by
the
storm
i
can
send
a
trusty
man
down
the
north
jersey
coast
to
examine
the
wreck
of
the
schooner
but
i
doubt
whether
he
could
learn
anything
from
it
he
drew
willet
aside
and
the
two
talked
together
a
while
in
a
low
voice
but
with
great
earnestness
we
have
our
beliefs
said
willet
at
length
but
we
shall
not
be
able
to
prove
anything
no
not
a
thing
and
having
nothing
upon
which
to
base
an
accusation
against
anybody
we
shall
accuse
nobody
tis
the
prudent
way
hardy
concurred
though
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
the
identity
of
the
man
who
set
this
most
wicked
pot
to
brewing
robert
had
his
own
beliefs
too
but
he
remained
silent
well
keep
the
story
of
your
absence
to
ourselves
said
mr
hardy
we
did
not
raise
any
alarm
believing
that
you
would
return
a
belief
due
in
large
measure
to
the
faith
of
tayoga
and
well
explain
that
you
were
called
away
suddenly
on
a
mission
of
a
somewhat
secret
nature
to
the
numerous
friends
who
have
been
asking
about
you
willet
concurred
and
he
also
said
it
was
desirable
that
they
should
depart
at
once
for
virginia
where
the
provincial
governors
were
to
meet
in
council
and
from
which
province
braddocks
force
or
a
considerable
portion
of
it
would
march
then
robert
after
a
substantial
supper
went
to
his
room
and
slept
the
next
morning
both
charteris
and
grosvenor
came
to
see
him
and
expressed
their
delight
at
his
return
a
few
days
later
they
were
at
sea
with
grosvenor
and
other
young
english
officers
bound
for
the
mouth
of
the
james
and
the
great
expedition
against
fort
duquesne
chapter
xiv
the
virginia
capital
they
were
on
a
large
schooner
and
while
robert
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
the
campaign
he
also
looked
back
with
regret
at
the
roofs
of
new
york
as
they
sank
behind
the
sea
the
city
suited
him
it
had
seemed
to
him
while
he
was
there
that
he
belonged
in
it
and
now
that
he
was
going
away
the
feeling
was
stronger
upon
him
than
ever
he
resolved
once
more
that
it
should
be
his
home
when
the
war
was
over
their
voyage
down
the
coast
was
stormy
and
long
baffling
winds
continually
beat
them
back
and
then
they
lay
for
long
periods
in
dead
calms
but
at
last
they
reached
the
mouth
of
the
james
going
presently
the
short
distance
overland
to
williamsburg
the
town
that
had
succeeded
jamestown
as
the
capital
of
the
great
province
of
virginia
spring
was
already
coming
here
in
the
south
and
in
the
lowlands
by
the
sea
and
the
tinge
of
green
in
the
foliage
and
the
warm
winds
were
grateful
after
the
winter
of
the
cold
north
robert
eager
as
always
for
new
scenes
and
fresh
knowledge
anticipated
with
curiosity
his
first
sight
of
williamsburg
one
of
the
oldest
british
towns
in
north
america
he
knew
that
it
was
not
large
but
he
found
it
even
smaller
than
he
had
expected
he
and
his
comrades
reached
it
on
horseback
and
they
found
that
it
contained
only
a
thousand
inhabitants
and
one
street
straight
and
very
wide
on
this
street
stood
the
brick
buildings
of
william
and
mary
the
oldest
college
in
the
country
a
new
capitol
erected
in
the
place
of
one
burned
not
long
before
and
a
large
building
called
the
governors
palace
it
looked
very
small
very
quiet
and
very
content
robert
was
conscious
of
a
change
in
atmosphere
that
was
not
a
mere
matter
of
temperature
keen
commercial
new
york
was
gone
here
people
talked
of
politics
and
the
land
the
men
who
came
into
williamsburg
on
horseback
or
in
their
high
coaches
were
owners
of
great
plantations
where
they
lived
as
patriarchs
and
feudal
lords
the
human
stock
was
purely
british
and
the
personal
customs
and
modes
of
thought
of
the
british
gentry
had
been
transplanted
i
like
it
said
grosvenor
i
feel
that
ive
found
england
again
there
appears
to
be
very
little
town
life
said
robert
it
seems
strange
that
williamsburg
is
so
small
when
virginia
has
many
more
people
than
new
york
or
pennsylvania
or
massachusetts
theyre
spread
upon
the
land
said
willet
ive
been
in
virginia
before
they
dont
care
much
about
commerce
but
youll
find
that
a
lot
of
the
men
who
own
the
great
plantations
are
hard
and
good
thinkers
robert
soon
discovered
that
in
virginia
a
town
was
rather
a
meeting
place
for
the
landed
aristocracy
than
a
commercial
center
the
arrival
of
the
british
troops
and
of
americans
from
other
colonies
brought
much
life
into
the
little
capital
the
people
began
to
pour
in
from
the
country
houses
and
the
single
street
was
thronged
with
the
best
horses
and
the
best
carriages
virginia
could
show
their
owners
attended
by
swarms
of
black
men
and
black
women
whose
mouths
were
invariably
stretched
in
happy
grins
their
splendid
white
teeth
glittering
there
was
much
splendor
a
great
mingling
of
the
fine
and
the
tawdry
as
was
inevitable
in
a
society
that
maintained
slavery
on
a
large
scale
nearly
all
the
carriages
had
been
brought
from
london
and
they
were
of
the
best
when
their
owners
drove
forth
in
the
streets
or
the
country
roundabout
they
were
escorted
by
black
coachmen
and
footmen
in
livery
the
younger
men
were
invariably
on
horseback
dressed
like
english
country
gentlemen
and
they
rode
with
a
skill
and
grace
that
robert
had
never
before
seen
equaled
the
parsons
as
in
england
rode
with
the
best
and
often
drank
with
them
too
it
was
a
proud
little
society
exclusive
perhaps
and
a
little
bit
provincial
too
possibly
but
it
was
soon
to
show
to
the
world
a
group
of
men
whose
abilities
and
reputation
and
service
to
the
state
have
been
unequaled
perhaps
since
ancient
athens
one
warm
afternoon
as
robert
walked
down
the
single
street
with
tayoga
and
grosvenor
he
saw
a
very
young
man
only
three
or
four
years
older
than
himself
riding
a
large
white
horse
the
riders
lofty
stature
apparent
even
on
horseback
attracted
roberts
notice
he
was
large
of
bone
too
with
hands
and
feet
of
great
size
and
a
very
powerful
figure
his
color
was
ruddy
and
high
showing
one
who
lived
out
of
doors
almost
all
the
time
the
man
robert
soon
learned
was
the
young
officer
george
washington
who
had
commanded
the
virginians
in
the
first
skirmish
with
the
french
and
indians
in
the
ohio
country
one
of
most
grave
and
sober
mien
said
grosvenor
i
take
him
to
be
of
fine
quality
there
can
scarce
be
a
doubt
of
it
said
robert
but
he
did
not
dream
then
that
succeeding
generations
would
reckon
the
horseman
the
first
man
of
all
time
robert
willet
and
tayoga
saw
the
governor
dinwiddie
a
thrifty
scotchman
and
offered
to
him
their
services
saying
that
they
wished
to
go
with
the
braddock
expedition
as
scouts
but
i
should
think
young
sir
said
dinwiddie
to
robert
that
you
at
least
would
want
a
commission
twill
be
easy
to
obtain
it
in
the
virginia
troops
i
thank
you
sir
for
the
offer
which
is
very
kind
said
robert
but
i
have
spent
a
large
part
of
my
life
in
the
woods
with
mr
willet
and
i
feel
that
i
can
be
of
more
use
as
a
scout
and
skirmisher
you
know
that
they
will
be
needed
badly
in
the
forest
moreover
mr
willet
would
not
be
separated
from
tayoga
who
in
the
land
of
the
six
nations
known
to
themselves
as
the
hodenosaunee
is
a
great
figure
governor
dinwiddie
regarded
the
onondaga
who
gave
back
his
gaze
steadily
the
shrewd
scotchman
knew
that
here
stood
a
man
and
he
treated
him
as
one
have
your
way
he
said
perhaps
you
are
right
many
think
that
general
braddock
has
little
to
fear
from
ambush
they
say
that
his
powerful
army
of
regulars
and
colonials
can
brush
aside
any
force
the
french
and
indians
may
gather
but
ive
been
long
enough
in
this
country
to
know
that
the
wilderness
always
has
its
dangers
such
eyes
as
the
eyes
of
you
three
will
have
their
value
you
shall
have
the
commissions
you
wish
willet
was
highly
pleased
he
had
been
even
more
insistent
than
robert
on
the
point
saying
they
must
not
sacrifice
their
freedom
and
independence
of
movement
but
grosvenor
was
much
surprised
an
army
rank
will
help
you
he
said
its
help
that
we
dont
need
said
robert
smiling
the
governor
showed
them
great
courtesy
he
liked
them
and
his
penetrating
scotch
mind
told
him
that
they
had
quality
despite
his
hunters
dress
which
he
had
resumed
willets
manners
were
those
of
the
great
world
and
dinwiddie
often
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
robert
seemed
to
him
to
be
wrapped
in
the
same
veil
of
mystery
and
he
judged
that
the
lad
whose
manners
were
not
inferior
to
those
of
willet
had
in
him
the
making
of
a
personage
as
for
tayoga
dinwiddie
had
been
too
long
in
america
and
he
knew
too
much
of
the
hodenosaunee
not
to
appreciate
his
great
position
an
insult
or
a
slight
in
virginia
to
the
coming
young
chief
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
would
soon
be
known
in
the
far
land
of
the
six
nations
and
its
cost
would
be
so
great
that
none
might
count
it
just
as
tall
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
so
a
personal
affront
may
sow
the
seed
of
a
great
war
or
break
a
great
alliance
and
dinwiddie
knew
it
the
governor
assisted
by
his
wife
and
two
daughters
entertained
at
his
house
and
robert
tayoga
willet
and
grosvenor
arrayed
in
their
best
attended
forming
conspicuous
figures
in
a
great
crowd
as
the
virginia
gentry
also
clad
in
their
finest
attended
robert
with
his
adaptable
and
imaginative
mind
was
at
home
at
once
among
them
he
liked
the
soft
southern
speech
the
grace
of
manner
and
the
good
feeling
that
obtained
they
were
even
more
closely
related
than
the
great
families
of
new
york
and
it
was
obvious
that
they
formed
a
cultivated
society
in
close
touch
with
the
mother
country
intensely
british
in
manner
and
mode
of
thought
and
devoted
in
both
theory
and
practice
to
personal
independence
as
the
spring
was
now
well
advanced
the
night
was
warm
and
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
governors
palace
were
left
open
negroes
in
livery
played
violins
and
harps
while
all
the
guests
who
wished
danced
others
played
cards
in
smaller
rooms
but
there
was
no
such
betting
as
robert
had
seen
at
bigots
ball
in
quebec
there
was
some
drinking
of
claret
and
punch
but
no
intoxication
the
general
note
was
of
great
gayety
but
with
proper
restraints
robert
noticed
that
the
men
spending
their
lives
in
the
open
air
and
having
abundant
and
wholesome
food
were
invariably
tall
and
big
of
bone
the
women
looked
strong
and
their
complexions
were
rosy
the
same
facility
of
mind
that
had
made
him
like
new
york
and
quebec
such
contrasting
places
made
him
like
williamsburg
too
which
was
different
from
either
quickly
at
home
in
this
society
as
elsewhere
the
hours
were
all
too
short
for
him
both
he
and
grosvenor
who
was
also
adaptable
seeing
good
in
everything
plunged
deep
into
the
festivities
he
danced
with
young
women
and
with
old
and
willet
more
than
once
gave
him
an
approving
glance
it
seemed
that
the
hunter
always
wished
him
to
fit
himself
into
any
group
with
which
he
might
be
cast
and
to
make
himself
popular
and
to
do
so
roberts
temperament
needed
little
encouragement
the
music
and
the
dancing
never
ceased
when
the
black
musicians
grew
tired
their
places
were
taken
by
others
as
black
and
as
zealous
and
on
they
went
in
a
ceaseless
alternation
robert
learned
that
the
guests
would
dance
all
night
and
far
into
the
next
day
and
that
frequently
at
the
great
houses
a
ball
continued
two
days
and
two
nights
about
three
oclock
in
the
morning
after
a
long
dance
that
left
him
somewhat
weary
he
went
upon
one
of
the
wide
piazzas
to
rest
and
take
the
fresh
air
there
his
attention
was
specially
attracted
by
two
young
men
who
were
waging
a
controversy
with
energy
but
without
acrimony
i
tell
you
james
said
one
who
was
noticeable
for
his
great
shock
of
fair
hair
and
his
blazing
red
face
that
at
two
miles
blenheim
is
unbeatable
unbeatable
he
may
be
walter
said
the
other
but
there
is
no
horse
so
good
that
there
isnt
a
better
blenheim
i
grant
you
is
a
splendid
three
year
old
but
my
cressy
is
just
about
twenty
yards
swifter
in
two
miles
there
is
not
another
such
colt
in
all
virginia
and
it
gives
me
great
pride
to
be
his
owner
the
other
laughed
a
soft
drawling
laugh
but
it
was
touched
with
incredulity
youre
a
vain
man
james
he
said
not
vain
for
yourself
but
vain
for
your
sorrel
colt
i
admit
my
vanity
walter
but
it
rests
upon
a
just
basis
cressy
i
repeat
is
the
best
three
year
old
in
virginia
which
of
course
means
the
best
in
all
the
colonies
and
i
have
a
thousand
weight
of
prime
tobacco
to
prove
it
my
plantation
grows
good
tobacco
too
james
and
i
also
have
a
thousand
weight
of
prime
leaf
which
talks
back
to
your
thousand
weight
and
tells
it
that
cressy
is
the
second
best
three
year
old
in
virginia
not
the
best
done
nothing
is
left
but
to
arrange
the
time
both
at
this
moment
noticed
robert
who
was
sitting
not
far
away
and
they
hailed
him
with
glad
voices
he
remembered
meeting
them
earlier
in
the
evening
they
were
young
men
walter
stuart
and
james
cabell
who
had
inherited
great
estates
on
the
james
and
they
shipped
their
tobacco
in
their
own
vessels
to
london
and
detecting
in
robert
a
somewhat
kindred
spirit
they
had
received
him
with
great
friendliness
already
they
were
old
acquaintances
in
feeling
if
not
in
time
lennox
listen
to
this
vain
boaster
exclaimed
cabell
he
has
a
good
horse
i
admit
but
his
spirit
has
become
unduly
inflated
about
it
you
know
dont
you
lennox
that
my
colt
cressy
has
all
virginia
beaten
in
speed
you
know
nothing
of
the
kind
lennox
exclaimed
stuart
but
you
do
know
that
my
three
year
old
blenheim
is
the
swiftest
horse
ever
bred
in
the
colony
now
dont
you
i
cant
give
an
affirmative
to
either
of
you
laughed
robert
as
ive
never
seen
your
horses
but
this
i
do
say
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
the
test
and
let
the
colts
decide
it
for
themselves
a
just
decision
o
judge
said
stuart
you
shall
have
an
honored
place
as
a
guest
when
the
match
is
run
what
say
you
to
tomorrow
morning
at
ten
james
a
fit
hour
walter
you
ride
blenheim
yourself
of
course
truly
and
you
take
the
mount
on
cressy
none
other
shall
ride
him
ive
black
boys
cunning
with
horses
but
since
its
horse
against
horse
it
should
also
be
master
against
master
a
match
well
made
and
twill
be
a
glorious
contest
come
lennox
you
shall
be
a
judge
and
so
shall
be
your
friend
willet
and
so
shall
that
splendid
indian
tayoga
robert
was
delighted
he
had
thrown
himself
with
his
whole
soul
into
the
virginia
life
and
he
was
eager
to
see
the
race
run
so
were
all
the
others
and
even
the
grave
eyes
of
tayoga
sparkled
when
he
heard
of
it
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
went
to
bed
but
he
was
up
at
noon
and
in
the
afternoon
he
went
to
the
house
of
burgesses
to
hear
the
governor
make
a
speech
to
the
members
on
the
war
and
its
emergencies
dinwiddie
like
shirley
the
governor
of
massachusetts
appreciated
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
crisis
and
his
address
was
solemn
and
weighty
he
told
them
that
the
shadow
in
the
north
was
black
and
menacing
the
french
were
an
ambitious
people
brave
tenacious
and
skillful
they
had
won
the
friendship
of
the
savages
and
now
they
dominated
the
wilderness
they
would
strike
heavy
blows
but
their
movements
were
enveloped
in
mystery
and
none
knew
where
or
when
the
sword
would
fall
the
spirit
animating
them
flowed
from
the
haughty
and
powerful
court
at
versailles
that
aimed
at
universal
dominion
it
became
the
virginians
as
it
became
the
people
of
all
the
colonies
to
gather
their
full
force
against
them
the
members
listened
with
serious
faces
and
robert
knew
that
the
governor
was
right
he
had
been
to
quebec
and
he
had
already
met
frenchmen
in
battle
none
understood
better
than
he
their
skill
courage
and
perseverance
and
the
shadow
in
the
north
was
very
heavy
and
menacing
to
him
too
but
his
depression
quickly
disappeared
when
he
returned
to
the
bright
sunshine
and
met
his
young
friends
again
the
virginians
were
a
singular
compound
of
gayety
and
gravity
away
from
the
house
of
burgesses
the
coming
horse
race
displaced
the
war
for
a
brief
space
it
was
the
great
topic
in
williamsburg
and
the
historic
names
blenheim
and
cressy
were
in
the
mouths
of
everybody
robert
soon
discovered
that
the
horses
were
well
known
and
each
had
its
numerous
group
of
partisans
their
qualities
were
discussed
by
the
women
and
girls
as
well
as
the
men
and
with
intelligence
robert
filled
with
the
spirit
of
it
laid
a
small
wager
on
blenheim
and
then
in
order
to
show
no
partiality
laid
another
in
another
quarter
but
of
exactly
the
same
amount
on
cressy
the
evening
witnessed
more
arrivals
in
williamsburg
drawn
by
the
news
of
the
race
and
young
men
galloped
up
and
down
the
wide
street
in
the
moonlight
testing
their
own
horses
and
riding
improvised
matches
the
rivalry
was
always
friendly
the
gentlemens
code
that
there
should
be
no
ill
feeling
prevailed
and
more
than
ever
the
entire
gathering
seemed
to
robert
one
vast
family
grosvenor
was
intensely
interested
in
the
race
and
also
in
the
new
sights
he
was
seeing
still
he
said
if
it
were
not
for
the
colored
people
i
could
imagine
with
ease
that
i
was
back
at
a
country
meeting
at
home
do
you
know
anything
lennox
about
these
horses
blenheim
and
cressypatriotic
fellows
their
owners
must
beand
could
you
give
a
chap
advice
about
laying
a
small
wager
i
know
nothing
about
them
except
what
stuart
and
cabell
say
what
do
they
say
stuart
knows
that
blenheim
is
the
fastest
horse
in
virginia
and
cabell
knows
that
cressy
is
and
so
there
the
matter
stands
until
the
race
is
run
i
think
ill
put
a
pound
on
blenheim
nevertheless
blenheim
has
a
much
more
modern
sound
than
cressy
and
im
all
for
modernity
there
was
an
excellent
race
track
the
sport
already
being
highly
developed
in
virginia
and
the
next
day
being
beautiful
the
seats
were
filled
very
early
in
the
morning
the
governor
with
his
wife
and
daughters
was
present
and
so
were
many
other
notables
robert
tayoga
and
grosvenor
were
in
a
group
of
nearly
fifty
young
virginians
all
about
were
women
and
girls
in
their
best
spring
dresses
many
imported
from
london
and
there
were
several
men
whom
robert
knew
by
their
garb
to
be
clergymen
colored
women
their
heads
wrapped
in
great
bandanna
handkerchiefs
were
selling
fruits
or
refreshing
liquids
the
whole
was
exhilarating
to
the
last
degree
and
all
the
youth
and
imagination
in
robert
responded
dangers
befell
him
but
delights
offered
themselves
also
and
he
took
both
as
they
came
several
preliminary
races
improvised
the
day
before
were
run
and
they
served
to
keep
the
crowd
amused
while
they
waited
for
the
great
match
robert
and
tayoga
then
moved
to
advanced
seats
near
the
governor
where
willet
was
already
placed
in
order
that
they
might
fulfill
their
honorable
functions
as
judges
and
the
people
began
to
stir
with
a
great
breath
of
expectation
they
were
packed
in
a
close
group
for
a
long
distance
and
roberts
eye
roved
over
them
noting
that
their
faces
ruddy
or
brown
were
those
of
an
open
air
race
like
the
english
almost
unconsciously
his
mind
traveled
back
to
a
night
in
new
york
when
he
had
seen
another
crowd
gather
in
a
theater
and
then
with
a
thrill
he
recalled
the
face
that
he
had
beheld
there
he
could
never
account
for
it
although
some
connection
of
circumstances
was
back
of
it
but
he
had
a
sudden
instinctive
belief
that
in
this
new
crowd
he
would
see
the
same
face
once
more
it
obsessed
him
like
a
superstition
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
the
horses
the
race
and
all
that
had
brought
him
there
his
eye
roved
on
and
then
down
near
the
front
of
the
seats
he
found
him
shaved
cleanly
and
dressed
neatly
like
a
gentleman
but
like
one
in
poor
circumstances
robert
saw
at
first
only
the
side
of
his
face
the
massive
jaw
the
strong
curving
chin
and
the
fair
hair
crisping
slightly
at
the
temples
but
he
would
have
known
him
anywhere
and
in
any
company
st
luc
sat
very
still
apparently
absorbed
in
the
great
race
which
would
soon
be
run
in
an
ordinary
time
any
stranger
in
williamsburg
would
have
been
noticed
but
this
was
far
from
being
an
ordinary
time
the
little
town
overflowed
with
british
troops
and
american
visitors
known
and
unknown
tayoga
or
willet
if
they
saw
him
might
recognize
him
although
robert
was
not
sure
but
they
too
might
keep
silent
for
a
little
while
he
wondered
why
st
luc
had
come
to
the
virginia
capital
a
journey
so
full
of
danger
for
him
was
he
following
him
was
it
because
of
some
tie
between
them
or
was
it
because
st
luc
was
now
spying
upon
the
angloamerican
preparations
he
understood
to
the
full
the
romantic
and
adventurous
nature
of
the
frenchman
and
knew
that
he
would
dare
anything
then
he
had
a
consuming
desire
for
the
eyes
of
st
luc
to
meet
his
and
he
bent
upon
him
a
gaze
so
long
and
of
such
concentration
that
at
last
the
chevalier
looked
up
st
luc
showed
recognition
but
in
a
moment
or
two
he
looked
away
robert
also
turned
his
eyes
in
another
direction
lest
tayoga
or
willet
should
follow
his
gaze
and
when
he
glanced
back
again
in
a
minute
or
two
st
luc
was
gone
his
roving
eyes
traveling
over
the
crowd
once
more
could
not
find
him
and
he
was
glad
he
believed
now
that
st
luc
had
come
to
williamsburg
to
discover
the
size
and
preparations
of
the
american
force
and
its
plan
and
robert
felt
that
he
must
have
him
seized
if
he
could
he
would
be
wanting
in
his
patriotism
and
duty
if
he
failed
to
do
so
he
must
sink
all
his
liking
for
st
luc
and
make
every
effort
to
secure
his
capture
but
there
was
a
sudden
murmur
that
grew
into
a
deep
hum
of
expectation
punctuated
now
and
then
by
shouts
blenheim
cressy
cabell
stuart
horses
and
horsemen
alike
seemed
to
have
their
partisans
in
about
equal
numbers
ladies
rose
to
their
feet
and
waved
bright
fans
and
men
gave
suggestions
to
those
on
whom
they
had
laid
their
money
the
race
for
a
space
crowded
st
luc
wholly
out
of
roberts
mind
stuart
and
cabell
each
dressed
very
neatly
in
jockey
attire
came
out
and
mounted
their
horses
which
the
grooms
had
been
leading
back
and
forth
the
three
year
olds
excited
by
the
noise
and
multitude
of
faces
leaped
and
strained
at
their
bits
robert
did
not
know
much
of
races
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
little
to
choose
between
either
horses
or
riders
the
circular
track
was
a
mile
in
length
and
they
would
round
it
twice
start
and
finish
alike
being
made
directly
in
front
of
the
judges
stand
the
starter
a
tall
virginian
finally
brought
the
horses
to
the
line
neck
and
neck
and
they
were
away
the
whole
crowd
rose
to
its
feet
and
shouted
approval
as
they
flashed
past
blenheim
was
a
bay
and
cressy
was
a
sorrel
and
when
they
began
to
turn
the
curve
in
the
distance
robert
saw
that
bay
and
sorrel
were
still
neck
and
neck
then
he
saw
them
far
across
the
field
and
neither
yet
had
the
advantage
now
robert
understood
why
the
virginians
loved
the
sport
the
test
of
a
horses
strength
and
endurance
and
of
a
horsemans
skill
and
judgment
was
thrilling
presently
he
found
that
he
was
shouting
with
the
shouting
multitude
and
sometimes
he
shouted
cressy
and
sometimes
he
shouted
blenheim
they
came
around
the
curve
the
finish
of
the
first
mile
being
near
and
robert
saw
the
nose
of
the
sorrel
creeping
past
the
nose
of
the
bay
a
shout
of
triumph
came
from
the
followers
of
cressy
and
cabell
but
the
partisans
of
blenheim
and
stuart
replied
that
the
race
was
not
yet
half
run
cressy
though
it
was
only
in
inches
was
still
gaining
the
sorrel
nose
crept
forward
farther
and
yet
a
little
farther
when
they
passed
the
judges
stand
cressy
led
by
a
head
and
a
neck
robert
having
no
favorite
before
now
felt
a
sudden
sympathy
for
blenheim
and
stuart
because
they
were
behind
and
he
began
to
shout
for
them
continuously
until
sorrel
and
bay
were
well
around
the
curve
on
the
second
mile
when
the
entire
crowd
became
silent
then
a
sharp
shout
came
from
the
believers
in
blenheim
and
stuart
the
bay
was
beginning
to
win
back
his
loss
the
cressy
men
were
silent
and
gloomy
as
blenheim
drawing
upon
the
stores
of
strength
that
had
been
conserved
continued
to
gain
until
now
the
bay
nose
was
creeping
past
the
sorrel
then
the
bay
was
a
full
length
ahead
and
that
sharp
shout
of
triumph
burst
now
from
the
blenheim
people
robert
found
his
feelings
changing
suddenly
and
he
was
all
for
cressy
and
cabell
the
joy
of
the
blenheim
people
did
not
last
long
the
sorrel
came
back
to
the
side
of
the
bay
the
second
mile
was
half
done
and
a
blanket
would
have
covered
the
two
it
was
yet
impossible
to
detect
any
sign
indicating
the
winner
the
eyes
of
tayoga
sitting
beside
robert
sparkled
the
indians
from
time
unknown
had
loved
ball
games
and
had
played
them
with
extraordinary
zest
and
fire
as
soon
as
they
came
to
know
the
horse
of
the
white
man
they
loved
racing
in
the
same
way
their
sporting
instincts
were
as
genuine
as
those
of
any
country
gentleman
it
is
a
great
race
said
tayoga
the
horses
run
well
and
the
men
ride
well
tododaho
himself
sitting
on
his
great
and
shining
star
does
not
know
which
will
win
the
kind
of
race
i
like
to
see
said
robert
stuart
and
cabell
were
justified
in
their
faith
in
their
horses
a
magnificent
pair
blenheim
and
cressy
it
has
been
said
dagaeoga
that
there
is
always
one
horse
that
can
run
faster
than
another
but
it
seems
that
neither
of
these
two
can
run
faster
than
the
other
now
blenheim
thrusts
his
nose
ahead
and
now
cressy
regains
the
lead
by
a
few
inches
now
they
are
so
nearly
even
that
they
seem
to
be
but
one
horse
and
one
rider
a
truly
great
race
tayoga
and
a
prettily
matched
pair
ah
the
bay
leads
no
tis
the
sorrel
now
they
are
even
again
and
the
finish
is
not
far
away
the
great
crowd
which
had
been
shouting
each
side
for
its
favorite
became
silent
as
blenheim
and
cressy
swept
into
the
stretch
stuart
and
cabell
leaning
far
over
the
straining
necks
begged
and
prayed
their
brave
horses
to
go
a
little
faster
and
blenheim
and
cressy
hearing
the
voices
that
they
knew
so
well
responded
but
in
the
same
measure
the
heads
were
even
as
if
they
had
been
locked
fast
and
there
was
still
no
sign
to
indicate
the
winner
faster
and
faster
they
came
their
riders
leaning
yet
farther
forward
continually
urging
them
and
they
thundered
past
the
stand
matched
so
evenly
that
not
a
hairs
breadth
seemed
to
separate
the
noses
of
the
sorrel
and
the
bay
its
a
dead
heat
exclaimed
robert
as
the
people
unable
to
restrain
their
enthusiasm
swarmed
over
the
track
and
such
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
judges
yet
it
was
the
belief
of
all
that
a
finer
race
was
never
run
in
virginia
and
while
the
horses
covered
with
blankets
were
walked
back
and
forth
to
cool
men
followed
them
and
uttered
their
admiration
stuart
and
cabell
were
eager
to
run
the
heat
over
after
the
horses
had
rested
but
the
judges
would
not
allow
it
no
no
lads
said
the
governor
be
content
you
have
two
splendid
horses
the
best
in
virginia
and
matched
evenly
moreover
you
rode
them
superbly
now
let
them
rest
with
the
ample
share
of
honor
that
belongs
to
each
stuart
and
cabell
after
the
heat
of
rivalry
was
over
thought
it
a
good
plan
shook
hands
with
great
warmth
three
or
four
times
each
swearing
that
the
other
was
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
and
then
with
a
great
group
of
friends
they
adjourned
to
the
tavern
where
huge
beakers
of
punch
were
drunk
and
mighty
todadaho
himself
although
he
looks
into
the
future
does
not
yet
know
which
is
the
better
horse
said
tayoga
it
is
well
some
things
should
remain
to
be
discovered
else
the
salt
would
go
out
of
life
thats
sound
philosophy
said
willet
its
the
mystery
of
things
that
attracts
us
and
that
race
ended
in
the
happiest
manner
possible
neither
owner
can
be
jealous
or
envious
of
the
other
instead
they
are
feeling
like
brothers
then
roberts
mind
with
a
sudden
rush
went
back
to
st
luc
and
his
sense
of
duty
tempted
him
to
speak
of
his
presence
to
willet
but
he
concluded
to
wait
a
little
he
looked
around
for
him
again
but
he
did
not
see
him
and
he
thought
it
possible
that
he
had
now
left
the
dangerous
neighborhood
of
williamsburg
as
they
walked
back
to
their
quarters
at
a
tavern
willet
informed
them
that
there
was
to
be
two
days
later
a
grand
council
of
provincial
governors
and
high
officers
at
alexandria
on
the
potomac
where
general
braddock
with
his
army
already
lay
in
camp
and
he
suggested
that
they
go
too
as
they
were
free
lances
with
their
authority
issuing
from
governor
dinwiddie
alone
they
could
do
practically
as
they
pleased
both
robert
and
tayoga
were
all
for
it
but
in
the
afternoon
they
as
well
as
willet
were
invited
to
a
race
dinner
to
be
given
at
the
tavern
that
evening
by
stuart
and
cabell
in
honor
of
the
great
contest
in
which
neither
had
lost
but
in
which
both
had
won
i
suppose
said
willet
that
while
here
we
might
take
our
full
share
of
virginia
hospitality
which
is
equal
to
any
on
earth
because
as
i
see
it
before
very
long
we
will
be
in
the
woods
where
so
much
to
eat
and
drink
will
not
be
offered
to
us
march
and
battle
will
train
us
down
the
dinner
to
thirty
guests
was
spread
in
the
great
room
of
the
tavern
and
the
black
servants
of
stuart
and
cabell
well
trained
dextrous
and
clad
in
livery
helped
those
of
the
landlord
to
serve
the
abundance
and
quality
of
the
food
were
amazing
besides
the
resources
of
civilization
air
wood
and
water
were
drawn
upon
for
game
virginia
already
renowned
for
hospitality
was
resolved
that
through
her
young
sons
stuart
and
cabell
she
should
do
her
best
that
night
a
dozen
young
british
officers
were
present
and
there
was
much
toasting
and
conviviality
the
tie
of
kinship
between
the
old
country
and
the
new
seemed
stronger
here
than
in
new
england
where
the
england
of
cromwell
still
prevailed
or
in
new
york
where
the
dutch
and
other
influences
not
english
were
so
powerful
they
had
begun
with
the
best
of
feeling
and
it
was
heightened
by
the
warmth
that
food
and
drink
bring
they
talked
with
animation
of
the
great
adventure
on
which
they
would
soon
start
as
stuart
and
cabell
and
most
of
the
virginians
were
going
with
braddock
they
drank
a
speedy
capture
of
fort
duquesne
and
confusion
to
the
french
and
their
red
allies
robert
imitating
the
example
of
tayoga
ate
sparingly
and
scarcely
tasted
the
punch
about
eleven
oclock
the
night
being
warm
unusually
warm
for
that
early
period
of
spring
and
nearly
all
the
guests
having
joined
in
the
singing
more
or
less
well
of
patriotic
songs
robert
thinking
that
his
absence
would
not
be
noticed
walked
outside
in
search
of
coolness
and
air
it
was
but
a
step
from
the
lights
and
brilliancy
of
the
tavern
to
the
darkness
of
williamsburgs
single
avenue
there
were
no
street
lanterns
and
only
a
moon
by
which
to
see
he
could
discern
the
dim
bulk
of
william
and
mary
college
and
of
the
governors
palace
but
except
near
at
hand
the
smaller
buildings
were
lost
in
the
dusk
a
breeze
touched
with
salt
as
if
from
the
sea
was
blowing
and
its
touch
was
so
grateful
on
roberts
face
that
he
walked
on
hat
in
hand
while
the
wind
played
on
his
cheeks
and
forehead
and
lifted
his
hair
then
a
darker
shadow
appeared
in
the
darkness
and
st
luc
stood
before
him
why
do
you
come
here
why
do
you
incur
such
danger
dont
you
know
that
i
must
give
warning
of
your
presence
exclaimed
robert
passionately
the
frenchman
laughed
lightly
he
seemed
very
well
pleased
with
himself
and
then
he
hummed
hier
sur
le
pont
davignon
jai
oui
chanter
la
belle
lon
la
your
danger
is
great
repeated
robert
not
as
great
as
you
think
said
st
luc
you
will
not
protect
me
you
will
warn
the
british
officers
that
a
french
spy
is
here
i
read
it
in
your
face
at
the
race
today
and
moreover
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
i
know
too
more
about
you
than
you
know
about
yourself
did
i
not
warn
you
in
new
york
to
beware
of
mynheer
adrian
van
zoon
you
did
and
i
know
that
you
meant
me
well
and
what
happened
i
was
kidnapped
by
a
slaver
and
i
was
to
have
been
taken
to
the
coast
of
africa
but
a
storm
intervened
and
saved
me
perhaps
the
slaver
was
acting
for
mynheer
van
zoon
but
i
talked
it
over
with
mr
hardy
and
we
havent
a
shred
of
proof
perhaps
a
storm
will
not
intervene
next
time
you
must
look
to
yourself
robert
lennox
and
you
to
yourself
chevalier
de
st
luc
im
grateful
to
you
for
the
warning
you
gave
me
and
other
acts
of
friendship
but
whatever
your
mission
may
have
been
in
new
york
im
sure
that
one
of
your
errands
perhaps
the
main
one
in
williamsburg
is
to
gather
information
for
france
and
sir
i
should
be
little
of
a
patriot
did
i
not
give
the
alarm
much
as
it
hurts
me
to
do
so
robert
saw
very
clearly
by
the
moonlight
that
the
blue
eyes
of
st
luc
were
twinkling
his
situation
might
be
dangerous
but
obviously
he
took
no
alarm
from
it
youll
bear
in
mind
mr
lennox
he
said
that
im
not
asking
you
to
shield
me
consider
me
a
french
spy
if
you
wishand
youll
not
be
wholly
wrongand
then
act
as
you
think
becomes
a
man
with
a
commission
as
army
scout
from
governor
dinwiddie
of
virginia
there
was
a
little
touch
of
irony
in
his
voice
his
adventures
and
romantic
spirit
was
in
the
ascendant
and
it
seemed
to
robert
that
he
was
giving
him
a
dare
that
he
would
have
endured
because
of
his
admiration
for
st
luc
and
also
because
of
his
gratitude
but
the
allusion
to
his
commission
from
the
governor
of
virginia
recalled
him
to
his
sense
of
duty
i
can
do
nothing
else
he
exclaimed
tis
a
poor
return
for
the
services
you
have
done
me
and
i
tender
my
apologies
for
the
action
im
about
to
take
but
guard
yourself
st
luc
and
you
lennox
look
well
to
yourself
when
braddock
marches
every
twig
and
leaf
will
spout
danger
his
light
manner
was
wholly
gone
for
the
moment
and
his
words
were
full
of
menace
up
the
street
a
sentinel
walked
back
and
forth
and
robert
could
hear
the
faint
fall
of
his
feet
on
the
sand
once
more
i
bid
you
beware
st
luc
he
exclaimed
and
raising
his
voice
he
shouted
a
spy
a
spy
he
heard
the
sentinel
drop
the
butt
of
his
musket
heavily
against
the
earth
utter
an
exclamation
and
then
run
toward
them
his
shout
had
also
been
heard
at
the
tavern
and
the
guests
bareheaded
began
to
pour
out
and
look
about
confusedly
to
see
whence
the
alarm
had
come
robert
looked
at
the
sentinel
who
was
approaching
rapidly
and
then
he
turned
to
see
what
st
luc
would
do
but
the
frenchman
was
gone
near
them
was
a
mass
of
shrubbery
and
he
believed
that
he
had
flitted
into
it
as
silently
as
the
passing
of
a
shadow
but
the
sentinel
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
dusky
figure
and
he
cried
who
was
he
what
is
it
a
spy
replied
robert
hastily
a
frenchman
whom
i
have
seen
in
canada
i
think
he
sprang
into
those
bushes
and
flowers
the
sentinel
and
robert
rushed
into
the
shrubbery
but
nothing
was
there
as
they
looked
about
in
the
dusk
robert
heard
a
refrain
distant
faint
and
taunting
hier
sur
le
pont
davignon
jai
oui
chanter
la
belle
lon
la
it
was
only
for
an
instant
then
it
died
like
a
summer
echo
and
he
knew
that
st
luc
was
gone
an
immense
weight
rolled
from
him
he
had
done
what
he
should
have
done
but
the
result
that
he
feared
had
not
followed
i
can
find
nothing
sir
said
the
sentinel
who
recognized
in
robert
one
of
superior
rank
nor
i
but
you
saw
the
figure
did
you
not
i
did
sir
twas
more
like
a
shadow
but
twas
a
man
ill
swear
robert
was
glad
to
have
the
sentinels
testimony
because
in
another
moment
the
revelers
were
upon
him
making
sport
of
him
for
his
false
alarm
and
asserting
that
not
his
eyes
but
the
punch
he
had
drunk
had
seen
a
french
spy
i
scarce
tasted
the
punch
said
robert
and
the
soldier
here
is
witness
that
i
spoke
true
a
farther
and
longer
search
was
organized
but
the
frenchman
had
vanished
into
the
thinnest
of
thin
air
as
robert
walked
with
willet
and
tayoga
back
to
the
tavern
the
hunter
said
i
suppose
it
was
st
luc
yes
but
why
did
you
think
it
was
he
because
it
was
just
the
sort
of
deed
he
would
do
did
you
speak
with
him
yes
and
i
told
him
i
must
give
the
alarm
he
disappeared
with
amazing
speed
and
silence
robert
made
a
brief
report
the
next
day
to
governor
dinwiddie
not
telling
that
st
luc
and
he
had
spoken
together
stating
merely
that
he
had
seen
him
giving
his
name
and
describing
him
as
one
of
the
most
formidable
of
the
french
forest
leaders
i
thank
you
mr
lennox
said
the
governor
your
information
shall
be
conveyed
to
general
braddock
yet
i
think
our
force
will
be
too
great
for
the
wilderness
bands
on
the
following
day
they
were
at
alexandria
on
the
potomac
where
the
great
council
was
to
be
held
here
braddocks
camp
was
spread
and
in
a
large
tent
he
met
governor
dinwiddie
of
virginia
governor
de
lancey
of
new
york
governor
sharpe
of
maryland
governor
dobbs
of
north
carolina
and
governor
shirley
of
massachusetts
an
elderly
lawyer
but
the
ablest
and
most
energetic
of
all
the
governors
it
was
the
most
momentous
council
yet
held
in
north
america
and
all
the
young
officers
waited
with
the
most
intense
eagerness
the
news
from
the
tent
robert
saw
braddock
as
he
went
in
a
middleaged
man
of
high
color
and
an
obstinate
chin
grosvenor
gave
him
some
of
the
gossip
about
the
general
london
has
many
stories
of
him
he
said
he
has
spent
most
of
his
life
in
the
army
he
is
a
gambler
but
brave
rough
but
generous
irritable
but
often
very
kind
opposition
inflames
him
but
he
likes
zeal
and
good
service
he
is
very
fond
of
your
young
mr
washington
who
i
hear
is
much
of
a
man
the
council
in
the
great
tent
was
long
and
weighty
and
well
it
might
have
been
even
far
beyond
the
wildest
thoughts
of
any
of
the
participants
these
were
the
beginnings
of
events
that
shook
not
only
america
but
europe
for
sixty
years
in
the
tent
they
agreed
upon
a
great
and
comprehensive
scheme
of
campaign
that
had
been
proposed
some
time
before
braddock
would
proceed
with
his
attack
upon
fort
duquesne
shirley
would
see
that
the
forces
of
new
england
seized
beausejour
and
de
lancey
would
have
colonel
william
johnson
to
move
upon
crown
point
and
then
niagara
acadia
also
would
be
taken
dinwiddie
after
shirley
was
the
most
vigorous
of
the
governors
and
he
promised
that
the
full
force
of
virginia
should
be
behind
braddock
but
to
shirley
was
given
the
great
vision
he
foresaw
the
complete
disappearance
of
french
power
from
north
america
and
to
achieve
a
result
that
he
desired
so
much
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
colonists
to
act
together
and
with
vigor
while
he
recognized
in
braddock
infirmities
of
temper
and
insufficient
knowledge
of
his
battlefield
he
knew
him
to
be
energetic
and
courageous
and
he
believed
that
the
first
blow
the
one
that
he
was
to
strike
at
fort
duquesne
would
inflict
a
mortal
blow
upon
france
in
the
new
world
in
every
vigorous
measure
that
he
proposed
dinwiddie
backed
him
and
the
other
governors
overborne
by
their
will
gave
their
consent
while
robert
sat
with
his
friends
in
the
shade
of
a
grove
awaiting
the
result
of
the
deliberations
in
the
tent
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
strong
thickset
figure
in
a
british
uniform
colonel
johnson
he
cried
and
running
forward
he
shook
hands
eagerly
with
colonel
william
johnson
why
colonel
he
exclaimed
i
didnt
dream
that
you
were
here
but
im
most
happy
to
see
you
and
i
to
see
you
mr
lennox
or
robert
as
i
shall
call
you
said
colonel
johnson
alexandria
is
a
long
journey
from
mount
johnson
but
you
see
im
here
awaiting
the
results
of
this
council
which
i
tell
you
may
have
vast
significance
for
north
america
but
why
are
you
not
in
the
tent
with
the
others
you
who
know
so
much
more
about
conditions
on
the
border
than
any
man
who
is
in
there
i
am
not
one
of
the
governors
robert
my
lad
nor
am
i
general
braddock
hence
im
not
eligible
but
im
not
to
be
neglected
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
we
are
planning
several
expeditions
and
that
im
to
lead
one
in
the
north
and
madam
johnson
and
everybody
at
your
home
are
they
well
as
well
of
body
as
human
beings
can
be
when
i
left
molly
told
me
that
if
i
saw
you
to
give
you
her
special
love
ah
you
young
blade
if
you
were
older
i
should
be
jealous
and
then
again
perhaps
i
shouldnt
and
joseph
young
thayendanegea
fierce
and
warlike
as
becomes
his
lineage
he
demands
if
i
lead
an
army
to
the
war
that
he
go
with
me
and
he
scarce
twelve
what
is
more
he
will
demand
and
insist
until
i
have
to
take
him
tis
a
true
eagle
that
young
joseph
but
here
is
willet
it
soothes
my
eyes
to
see
you
again
brave
hunter
and
tayoga
too
who
is
fully
as
welcome
he
shook
hands
with
them
both
and
the
onondaga
gravely
asked
what
news
of
my
people
waraiyageh
colonel
johnsons
face
clouded
things
do
not
go
well
between
us
and
the
vale
of
onondaga
he
replied
the
hodenosaunee
complain
of
the
indian
commissioners
at
albany
and
with
justice
moreover
the
french
advance
and
the
superior
french
vigor
create
a
fear
that
the
british
and
americans
may
lose
then
the
hodenosaunee
will
be
left
alone
to
fight
the
french
and
all
the
hostile
tribes
father
drouillard
has
come
back
and
is
working
with
his
converts
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
will
never
go
with
the
french
declared
tayoga
with
emphasis
although
the
times
seem
dark
and
mens
minds
may
waver
for
a
while
they
will
remain
loyal
to
their
ancient
allies
their
doubts
will
cease
waraiyageh
when
the
king
across
the
sea
takes
away
the
power
of
dealing
with
us
from
the
dutch
commissioners
at
albany
and
gives
it
to
you
you
who
know
us
so
well
and
who
have
always
been
our
friend
colonel
johnsons
face
flushed
with
pleasure
your
opinion
of
me
is
too
high
tayoga
he
said
but
ill
not
deny
that
it
gratifies
me
to
hear
it
have
you
heard
anything
from
fort
refuge
and
colden
and
wilton
and
the
others
asked
robert
an
oneida
runner
brought
a
letter
just
before
i
left
mount
johnson
the
brave
philadelphia
lads
still
hold
the
little
fortress
and
have
occasional
skirmishes
with
wandering
bands
theirs
has
been
a
good
work
well
done
but
while
colonel
johnson
was
not
a
member
of
the
council
and
could
not
sit
with
it
he
had
a
great
reputation
with
all
the
governors
and
the
next
day
he
was
asked
to
appear
before
them
and
general
braddock
where
he
was
treated
with
the
consideration
due
to
a
man
of
his
achievements
and
where
the
council
without
waiting
for
the
authority
of
the
english
king
gave
him
full
and
complete
powers
to
treat
with
the
hodenosaunee
and
to
heal
the
wounds
inflicted
upon
the
pride
of
the
nations
by
the
commissioners
at
albany
he
was
thus
made
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
in
north
america
and
he
was
also
as
he
had
said
to
lead
the
expedition
against
crown
point
he
came
forth
from
the
council
exultant
his
eyes
glowing
tis
even
more
than
i
had
hoped
he
said
to
willet
and
now
i
must
say
farewell
to
you
and
the
brave
lads
with
you
we
have
come
to
the
edge
of
great
things
and
there
is
no
time
to
waste
he
hastened
northward
the
council
broke
up
the
next
day
and
the
visiting
governors
hurried
back
to
their
respective
provinces
to
prepare
for
the
campaigns
leaving
braddock
to
strike
the
first
blow
chapter
xv
the
forest
fight
robert
thought
they
would
march
at
once
but
annoying
delays
occurred
he
had
noticed
that
hamilton
the
governor
of
the
great
neighboring
province
of
pennsylvania
was
not
present
at
the
council
but
he
did
not
know
the
cause
of
it
until
stuart
the
young
virginian
told
him
pennsylvania
is
in
a
huff
he
said
because
general
braddocks
army
has
been
landed
at
alexandria
instead
of
philadelphia
truth
to
tell
for
an
expedition
against
fort
duquesne
philadelphia
would
have
been
a
nearer
and
better
place
but
i
hear
that
one
john
hanbury
a
powerful
merchant
who
trades
much
in
virginia
wanted
the
troops
to
come
this
way
that
he
might
sell
them
supplies
and
he
persuaded
the
duke
of
newcastle
to
choose
alexandria
tis
a
bad
state
of
affairs
lennox
but
you
and
i
cant
remedy
it
the
chief
trouble
is
between
the
general
and
the
pennsylvanians
many
of
whom
are
quakers
and
germans
as
obstinate
people
as
this
world
has
ever
produced
the
differences
and
difficulties
were
soon
patent
to
all
a
month
of
spring
was
passing
and
the
army
was
far
from
having
the
necessary
supplies
neither
virginia
nor
pennsylvania
responded
properly
in
pennsylvania
there
was
a
bitter
quarrel
between
the
people
and
the
proprietary
government
that
hampered
action
many
of
the
contractors
who
were
to
furnish
equipment
thought
much
more
of
profit
than
of
patriotism
braddock
brave
and
honest
but
tactless
and
wholly
ignorant
of
the
conditions
predominant
in
any
new
country
raged
and
stormed
he
denounced
the
virginia
troops
that
came
to
his
standard
calling
shameful
their
lack
of
uniforms
and
what
he
considered
their
lack
of
discipline
robert
heard
that
in
these
turbulent
days
young
washington
whom
braddock
had
taken
on
his
staff
as
a
colonel
and
for
whom
he
had
a
warm
personal
regard
was
the
best
mediator
between
the
testy
general
and
the
stubborn
population
in
his
difficult
position
and
while
yet
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
he
was
showing
all
the
great
qualities
of
character
that
he
was
to
display
so
grandly
in
the
long
war
twenty
years
later
tis
related
said
willet
that
general
braddock
will
listen
to
anything
from
him
that
he
has
the
most
absolute
confidence
in
his
honesty
and
good
judgment
and
judging
from
what
i
hear
general
braddock
is
right
but
to
robert
despite
the
anxieties
the
days
were
happy
as
he
had
affiliated
readily
with
the
young
virginians
he
was
also
quickly
a
friend
of
the
young
british
officers
who
were
anxious
to
learn
about
the
new
conditions
into
which
they
had
been
cast
with
so
little
preparation
there
was
captain
robert
orme
braddocks
aidedecamp
a
fine
manly
fellow
for
whom
he
soon
formed
a
reciprocal
liking
and
the
son
of
sir
peter
halket
a
lieutenant
and
morris
an
american
another
aidedecamp
and
young
william
shirley
the
son
of
the
governor
of
massachusetts
who
had
become
braddocks
secretary
he
also
became
well
acquainted
with
older
officers
gladwin
who
was
to
defend
detroit
so
gallantly
against
pontiac
and
his
allied
tribes
gates
gage
barton
and
others
many
of
whom
were
destined
to
serve
again
on
one
side
or
other
in
the
great
revolution
grosvenor
knew
all
the
englishmen
and
often
in
the
evenings
since
may
had
now
come
they
sat
about
the
camp
fires
and
robert
listened
with
eagerness
as
they
told
stories
of
gay
life
in
london
tales
of
the
theater
of
the
heavy
betting
at
the
clubs
and
the
races
and
now
and
then
in
low
tones
some
gossip
of
royalty
tayoga
was
more
than
welcome
in
this
group
as
the
great
thayendanegea
was
destined
to
be
years
later
his
height
his
splendid
appearance
his
dignity
and
his
manners
were
respected
and
admired
willet
sometimes
sat
with
them
but
said
little
robert
knew
that
he
approved
of
his
new
friendships
willet
was
undoubtedly
anxious
the
delays
which
were
still
numerous
weighed
heavily
upon
him
and
he
confided
to
robert
that
every
day
lost
would
increase
the
danger
of
the
march
the
french
and
indians
of
course
know
our
troubles
he
said
st
luc
has
gone
like
an
arrow
into
the
wilderness
with
all
the
news
about
us
and
hes
not
the
only
one
if
we
could
adjust
this
trouble
with
the
pennsylvanians
we
might
start
at
once
an
hour
or
two
after
he
uttered
his
complaint
robert
saw
a
middle
aged
man
not
remarkable
of
appearance
talking
with
braddock
his
dress
was
homespun
and
careless
but
his
large
head
was
beautifully
shaped
and
his
features
though
they
might
have
been
called
homely
shone
with
the
light
of
an
extraordinary
intelligence
his
manner
as
he
talked
to
braddock
without
showing
any
tinge
of
deference
was
soothing
robert
saw
at
once
despite
his
homespun
dress
that
here
was
a
man
of
the
great
world
and
of
great
affairs
who
is
he
he
said
to
willet
its
benjamin
franklin
of
pennsylvania
replied
the
hunter
i
hear
hes
one
of
the
shrewdest
men
in
all
the
colonies
and
i
dont
doubt
the
report
it
was
roberts
first
sight
of
franklin
certainly
not
the
least
in
that
amazing
group
of
men
who
founded
the
american
union
they
say
continued
willet
that
hes
already
achieved
the
impossible
that
hes
drawing
general
braddock
and
the
pennsylvanians
together
and
that
well
soon
get
weapons
horses
and
all
the
other
supplies
we
need
it
was
no
false
news
franklin
had
done
what
he
alone
could
do
one
of
the
greatest
masters
of
diplomacy
the
world
has
ever
known
he
brought
braddock
and
pennsylvania
together
and
smoothed
out
the
difficulties
all
the
needed
supplies
began
to
flow
in
and
on
the
tenth
of
an
eventful
may
the
whole
army
started
from
wills
creek
to
which
point
it
had
advanced
while
franklin
was
removing
the
difficulties
a
new
fort
named
cumberland
had
been
established
there
and
stalwart
virginians
had
been
cutting
a
road
ahead
through
the
wilderness
the
place
was
on
the
edge
of
the
unending
forest
the
narrow
fringe
of
settlements
on
the
atlantic
coast
was
left
behind
and
henceforth
they
must
march
through
regions
known
only
to
the
indians
and
the
woods
rangers
but
it
was
a
fine
army
two
british
regiments
under
halket
and
dunbar
their
numbers
reinforced
by
virginia
volunteers
and
five
hundred
other
virginians
divided
into
nine
companies
there
was
a
company
of
british
sailors
too
and
artillery
and
hundreds
of
wagons
and
baggage
horses
among
the
teamsters
was
a
strong
lad
named
daniel
boone
destined
to
immortality
as
the
most
famous
of
all
pioneers
robert
willet
and
tayoga
could
have
had
horses
to
ride
but
against
the
protests
of
grosvenor
and
their
other
new
english
friends
they
declined
them
they
knew
that
they
could
scout
along
the
flanks
of
an
army
far
better
on
foot
in
one
way
said
willet
to
grosvenor
we
three
robert
tayoga
and
i
are
going
back
home
the
lads
at
least
have
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
in
the
forest
and
to
me
it
has
given
a
kindly
welcome
for
these
many
years
it
may
look
inhospitable
to
you
who
come
from
a
country
of
roads
and
open
fields
but
its
not
so
to
us
we
know
its
ways
we
can
find
shelter
where
you
would
see
none
and
it
offers
food
to
us
where
you
would
starve
and
youre
a
young
man
of
intelligence
too
at
least
i
can
see
its
beauty
laughed
grosvenor
as
he
looked
upon
the
great
green
wilderness
stretching
away
and
away
to
the
far
blue
hills
in
truth
tis
a
great
and
romantic
adventure
to
go
with
a
force
like
ours
into
an
unknown
country
of
such
majestic
quality
he
looked
with
a
kindling
eye
from
the
wilderness
back
to
the
army
the
greatest
that
had
yet
been
gathered
in
the
forest
the
red
coats
of
the
soldiers
gleaming
now
in
the
spring
sunshine
and
the
air
resounding
with
whips
as
the
teamsters
started
their
trains
a
great
force
a
grand
force
said
robert
catching
his
enthusiasm
the
french
and
indians
cant
stand
before
it
how
far
is
fort
duquesne
asked
grosvenor
in
the
extreme
western
part
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
many
days
march
from
here
at
least
we
claim
that
its
in
pennsylvania
province
although
the
french
assert
its
on
their
soil
and
they
have
possession
but
its
in
the
ohio
country
because
the
waters
there
flow
westward
the
alleghany
and
monongahela
joining
at
the
fort
and
forming
the
great
ohio
and
so
we
shall
see
much
of
the
wilderness
well
im
not
sorry
lennox
twill
be
something
to
talk
about
in
england
i
dont
think
they
realize
there
the
vastness
and
magnificence
of
the
colonies
that
day
a
trader
named
croghan
brought
about
fifty
indian
warriors
to
the
camp
among
them
a
few
belonging
to
the
hodenosaunee
and
offered
their
services
as
scouts
and
skirmishers
braddock
who
loved
regularity
and
outward
discipline
gazed
at
them
in
astonishment
savages
he
said
we
will
have
none
of
them
the
indians
uttering
no
complaint
disappeared
in
the
green
forest
with
willet
and
tayoga
gazing
somberly
after
them
twas
a
mistake
said
the
hunter
they
would
have
been
our
eyes
and
ears
where
we
needed
eyes
and
ears
most
a
warrior
of
my
kin
was
among
them
said
tayoga
word
will
fly
north
that
an
insult
has
been
offered
to
the
hodenosaunee
but
said
willet
colonel
william
johnson
will
take
a
word
of
another
kind
as
you
know
tayoga
as
i
know
and
as
all
the
nations
of
the
hodenosaunee
know
waraiyageh
is
their
friend
he
will
speak
to
them
no
word
that
is
not
true
he
will
brush
away
all
that
web
of
craft
and
cunning
and
cheating
spun
by
the
indian
commissioners
at
albany
and
he
will
see
that
there
is
no
infringement
upon
the
rights
of
the
great
league
waraiyageh
will
do
all
that
if
he
can
reach
mount
johnson
in
time
said
tayoga
but
onontio
rises
before
the
dawn
and
he
does
not
sleep
until
after
midnight
he
sings
beautiful
songs
in
the
ears
of
the
warriors
and
the
songs
he
sings
seem
to
be
true
already
the
french
and
their
allies
have
been
victorious
everywhere
save
at
fort
refuge
and
they
carry
the
trophies
of
triumph
into
canada
but
the
time
for
us
to
strike
a
great
blow
is
at
hand
tayoga
said
robert
who
with
grosvenor
had
been
listening
behold
this
splendid
army
no
such
force
was
ever
before
sent
into
the
american
wilderness
when
we
take
fort
duquesne
we
shall
hold
the
key
to
the
whole
ohio
country
and
we
shall
turn
it
in
the
lock
and
fasten
it
against
the
governor
general
of
canada
and
all
his
allies
but
the
wilderness
is
mighty
said
tayoga
even
the
army
of
the
great
english
king
is
small
when
it
enters
its
depths
on
the
other
hand
so
is
that
of
the
enemy
much
smaller
than
ours
said
grosvenor
soon
after
croghan
and
his
indians
left
the
camp
a
figure
tall
dark
and
somber
followed
by
a
dozen
men
wild
of
appearance
and
clad
in
hunters
garb
emerged
from
the
forest
and
walked
in
silence
toward
general
braddocks
tent
the
regular
soldiers
stared
at
them
in
astonishment
but
their
dark
leader
took
no
notice
robert
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
pleasure
black
rifle
he
said
and
who
is
black
rifle
asked
grosvenor
a
great
hunter
and
scout
and
a
friend
of
mine
im
glad
hes
here
the
general
can
find
many
uses
for
black
rifle
and
his
men
he
ran
forward
and
greeted
black
rifle
who
smiled
one
of
his
rare
smiles
at
sight
of
the
youth
willet
and
tayoga
gave
him
the
same
warm
welcome
what
news
black
rifle
asked
robert
the
french
and
indians
gather
at
fort
duquesne
to
meet
you
they
are
not
in
great
force
but
the
wilderness
will
help
them
and
the
best
of
the
french
leaders
are
there
have
you
heard
anything
of
st
luc
asked
robert
we
met
a
seneca
runner
who
had
seen
him
the
senecas
are
not
at
war
with
the
french
and
the
man
talked
with
him
a
little
but
the
frenchman
didnt
tell
him
anything
we
think
he
was
on
the
way
to
fort
duquesne
to
join
the
other
french
leaders
there
have
you
heard
the
names
of
any
of
these
frenchmen
besides
st
luc
theres
beaujeu
dumas
ligneris
and
contrecoeur
who
commands
french
regulars
and
canadian
troops
are
in
the
fort
and
the
heathen
are
pouring
in
from
the
west
and
north
those
are
brave
and
skillful
men
said
willet
as
he
listened
to
the
names
of
the
french
leaders
who
would
oppose
them
but
twas
good
of
you
black
rifle
to
come
with
these
lads
of
yours
to
help
us
after
the
men
had
enjoyed
food
and
a
little
rest
they
were
taken
into
the
great
tent
where
the
general
sat
willet
having
procured
the
interview
and
accompanying
them
robert
waited
near
with
grosvenor
and
tayoga
knowing
how
useful
black
rifle
and
his
men
could
be
to
a
wilderness
expedition
and
hoping
that
they
would
be
thrown
together
in
future
service
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
then
black
rifle
strode
from
the
tent
his
face
dark
as
night
his
men
followed
him
and
almost
without
a
word
they
left
the
camp
plunged
into
the
forest
and
disappeared
willet
also
came
from
the
tent
crestfallen
what
has
happened
dave
asked
robert
in
astonishment
the
worst
i
suppose
that
when
unlike
meets
unlike
only
trouble
can
come
i
introduced
black
rifle
and
his
men
to
general
braddock
they
did
not
salute
they
did
not
take
off
their
caps
in
his
presencenot
knowing
of
course
that
such
things
were
done
in
armies
general
braddock
rebuked
them
i
smoothed
it
all
over
as
much
as
i
could
then
he
demanded
what
they
wanted
there
as
a
haughty
giver
of
gifts
would
speak
to
a
suppliant
black
rifle
said
he
and
his
men
came
to
watch
on
the
front
and
flanks
of
the
army
against
indian
ambush
knowing
how
much
it
was
needed
braddock
laughed
and
sneered
he
said
that
an
army
such
as
his
did
not
need
to
fear
a
few
wandering
indians
and
in
any
event
it
had
eyes
of
its
own
to
watch
for
itself
black
rifle
said
he
doubted
it
that
soldiers
in
the
woods
could
seldom
see
anything
but
themselves
there
was
blame
on
both
sides
but
men
like
general
braddock
and
black
rifle
cant
understand
each
other
theyll
never
understand
each
other
and
hot
with
wrath
black
rifle
has
taken
his
band
and
gone
into
the
woods
nor
will
he
come
back
and
we
need
him
i
tell
you
robert
we
need
him
we
need
him
it
is
bad
said
tayoga
an
army
can
never
have
too
many
eyes
robert
was
deeply
disappointed
he
regretted
not
only
the
loss
of
black
rifle
and
his
men
but
the
further
evidence
of
an
unyielding
temperament
on
the
part
of
their
commander
his
own
mind
however
so
ready
to
comprehend
the
mind
of
others
could
understand
braddocks
point
of
view
to
the
general
black
rifle
and
his
men
were
mere
woods
rovers
savages
themselves
in
everything
except
race
and
the
army
that
he
led
was
invincible
well
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
said
theyve
gone
and
theyre
a
great
loss
but
the
rest
of
us
will
try
to
do
the
work
they
would
have
done
that
is
so
said
tayoga
gravely
at
last
the
army
moved
proudly
away
into
the
wilderness
hundreds
of
axmen
going
ahead
cut
a
road
twelve
feet
wide
along
which
cavalry
infantry
artillery
and
wagons
and
pack
horses
stretched
for
miles
the
weather
was
beautiful
the
forest
was
both
beautiful
and
grand
and
to
most
of
the
englishmen
and
virginians
the
march
appealed
as
a
great
and
romantic
adventure
the
trees
were
in
the
tender
green
leafage
of
early
may
and
their
solid
expanse
stretched
away
hundreds
and
thousands
of
miles
into
the
unknown
west
early
wild
flowers
a
shy
pink
or
a
modest
blue
bloomed
in
the
grass
deer
started
from
their
coverts
crashed
through
the
thickets
and
the
sky
darkened
with
the
swarms
of
wild
fowl
flying
north
birds
of
brilliant
plumage
flashed
among
the
leaves
and
often
chattered
overhead
heedless
of
the
passing
army
now
and
then
the
soldiers
sang
and
the
song
passed
from
the
head
of
the
column
along
its
rippling
red
yellow
and
brown
length
of
four
miles
it
was
a
cheerful
army
more
it
was
a
gay
army
enjoying
the
wilderness
which
it
was
seeing
at
one
of
the
finest
periods
of
the
year
wondering
at
the
magnificence
of
the
forest
and
the
great
number
of
streams
that
came
rushing
down
from
the
mountains
its
a
noble
country
said
grosvenor
to
robert
ill
admit
all
that
you
claim
for
it
and
theres
so
much
of
it
grosvenor
even
allowing
for
the
portion
the
very
big
portion
the
french
claim
but
from
which
we
are
going
to
drive
them
very
soon
robert
my
lad
i
think
so
too
grosvenor
often
robert
willet
and
tayoga
went
far
ahead
on
swift
foot
searching
the
forest
for
ambush
and
finding
none
they
would
come
back
and
watch
the
axmen
three
hundred
in
number
who
were
cutting
the
road
for
the
army
they
were
stalwart
fellows
skilled
in
their
business
and
their
axes
rang
through
the
woods
robert
felt
regret
when
he
saw
the
splendid
trees
fall
and
be
dragged
to
one
side
there
to
rot
despite
the
fact
that
the
unbroken
forest
covered
millions
of
square
miles
the
camps
at
night
were
scenes
of
good
humor
scouts
and
flankers
were
thrown
out
in
the
forest
and
huge
fires
were
built
of
the
fallen
wood
which
was
abundant
everywhere
the
flames
roaring
and
leaping
threw
a
ruddy
light
over
the
soldiers
and
gave
them
pleasant
warmth
as
often
in
the
hills
the
dusk
came
on
heavy
with
chill
despite
the
favorable
nature
of
the
season
some
of
the
soldiers
unused
to
hardships
fell
ill
and
more
than
a
week
later
when
they
reached
a
place
known
as
the
little
meadows
braddock
left
there
the
sick
and
the
heavy
baggage
with
a
rear
guard
under
colonel
dunbar
a
scout
had
brought
word
that
a
formidable
force
of
french
regulars
was
expected
to
reinforce
the
garrison
at
fort
duquesne
and
the
general
was
anxious
to
forestall
them
young
washington
in
whom
he
had
great
confidence
also
advised
him
to
push
on
and
now
the
army
of
chosen
troops
increased
its
speed
robert
came
into
contact
with
braddock
only
once
or
twice
and
then
he
was
noticed
with
a
nod
but
on
the
whole
he
was
glad
to
escape
so
easily
the
general
brave
and
honest
but
irritable
had
a
closed
mind
he
thought
all
things
should
be
done
in
the
way
to
which
he
was
used
and
he
had
little
use
for
the
americans
save
for
young
washington
and
young
morris
who
were
on
his
staff
and
young
shirley
who
was
his
secretary
to
them
he
was
invariably
kind
and
considerate
the
regular
officers
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
with
robert
tayoga
and
willet
who
having
their
commissions
as
scouts
roamed
as
they
pleased
and
even
on
foot
their
pace
being
so
much
greater
than
that
of
the
army
they
often
went
far
ahead
in
the
night
seeking
traces
of
the
enemy
now
although
the
march
was
not
resisted
they
saw
unmistakable
signs
that
it
was
watched
they
found
trails
of
small
indian
bands
and
several
soldiers
who
straggled
into
the
forest
were
killed
and
scalped
braddock
was
enraged
but
not
alarmed
the
army
would
brush
away
these
flies
and
proceed
to
the
achievement
of
its
object
the
capture
of
fort
duquesne
the
soldiers
from
england
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
their
scalped
comrades
it
was
a
new
form
of
war
to
them
and
very
ghastly
robert
tayoga
and
willet
were
the
best
scouts
and
the
regular
officers
soon
learned
to
rely
on
them
grosvenor
often
begged
to
go
with
them
but
they
laughingly
refused
we
dont
claim
to
be
of
special
excellence
ourselves
grosvenor
said
robert
but
such
work
needs
a
very
long
training
one
so
to
speak
must
be
born
to
it
and
to
be
born
to
it
you
have
to
be
born
in
this
country
and
not
in
england
it
was
about
the
close
of
june
and
they
had
been
nearly
three
weeks
on
the
way
when
the
three
scouting
on
a
moonlight
night
struck
a
trail
larger
than
usual
tayoga
reckoned
that
it
had
been
made
by
at
least
a
dozen
warriors
and
willet
agreed
with
him
and
behold
the
trace
of
the
big
moccasin
great
bear
said
the
onondaga
pointing
to
a
faint
impression
among
the
leaves
it
is
very
large
and
it
turns
in
much
we
do
not
see
it
for
the
first
time
tandakora
said
willet
it
can
be
none
other
we
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
seeing
it
the
ojibway
like
a
wolf
will
rush
to
the
place
of
killing
i
am
not
surprised
great
bear
it
is
strange
perhaps
that
we
have
not
seen
his
footsteps
before
no
doubt
he
has
looked
many
times
upon
the
marching
army
since
tandakora
is
here
probably
leading
the
indian
scouts
well
have
to
take
every
precaution
ourselves
i
like
my
scalp
and
i
like
for
it
to
remain
where
it
has
grown
on
the
top
of
my
head
they
moved
now
with
the
most
extreme
care
always
keeping
under
cover
of
bushes
and
never
making
any
sound
as
they
walked
but
the
army
kept
on
steadily
in
the
road
cut
for
it
by
the
axmen
encounters
between
the
flankers
and
small
bands
still
occurred
but
there
was
yet
no
sign
of
serious
resistance
and
the
fort
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
ive
no
doubt
the
french
commander
will
abandon
it
said
grosvenor
to
robert
hell
conclude
that
our
army
is
too
powerful
for
him
i
scarce
think
so
replied
robert
doubtfully
tis
not
the
french
way
at
least
not
on
this
continent
like
as
not
they
will
depend
on
the
savages
whom
they
have
with
them
they
had
been
on
the
march
nearly
a
month
when
they
came
to
turtle
creek
which
flows
into
the
monongahela
only
eight
miles
from
fort
duquesne
a
strong
fortress
of
logs
with
bastions
ravelins
ditch
glacis
and
covered
ways
standing
at
the
junction
of
the
twin
streams
the
monongahela
and
the
alleghany
that
form
the
great
ohio
here
they
made
a
little
halt
and
the
scouts
who
had
been
sent
into
the
woods
reported
silence
and
desolation
the
army
rejoiced
it
had
been
a
long
march
and
the
wilderness
is
hard
for
those
not
used
to
it
even
in
the
best
of
times
victory
was
now
almost
in
sight
the
next
day
perhaps
they
would
march
into
fort
duquesne
and
take
possession
and
doubtless
a
strong
detachment
would
be
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
french
and
indians
full
warrant
had
they
for
their
expectations
as
nothing
seemed
more
peaceful
than
the
wilderness
the
flames
from
the
cooking
fires
threw
their
ruddy
light
over
bough
and
bush
and
disclosed
no
enemy
and
as
the
glow
of
the
coals
died
down
the
peaceful
tails
of
the
night
birds
showed
that
the
forest
was
undisturbed
far
in
the
night
robert
tayoga
and
willet
crept
through
the
woods
to
fort
duquesne
they
found
many
small
trails
of
both
white
men
and
red
men
but
none
indicating
a
large
force
at
last
they
saw
a
light
under
the
western
horizon
which
they
believed
to
come
from
duquesne
itself
perhaps
theyve
burned
the
fort
and
are
abandoning
it
said
robert
willet
shook
his
head
not
likely
he
said
its
more
probable
that
the
light
comes
from
great
fires
around
which
the
savages
are
dancing
the
war
dance
what
do
you
think
tayoga
that
the
great
bear
is
right
but
surely
said
robert
they
cant
hope
to
withstand
an
army
like
ours
robert
said
willet
youve
lived
long
enough
in
it
to
know
that
anything
is
possible
in
the
wilderness
contrecoeur
the
french
commander
at
duquesne
is
a
brave
and
capable
man
beaujeu
who
stands
next
to
him
has
they
say
a
soul
of
fire
you
know
what
st
luc
is
the
bravest
of
the
brave
and
as
wise
as
a
fox
and
dumas
and
ligneris
are
great
partisan
leaders
do
you
think
these
men
will
run
away
without
a
fight
but
they
must
depend
chiefly
on
the
indians
even
so
they
wont
let
the
indians
run
away
either
were
bound
to
have
some
kind
of
a
battle
somewhere
though
we
ought
to
win
do
you
know
the
generals
plans
for
tomorrow
were
to
start
at
dawn
well
cross
the
monongahela
for
the
second
time
about
noon
or
a
little
later
and
then
if
the
french
and
indians
have
run
away
as
you
seemed
a
little
while
ago
to
believe
they
would
well
proceed
colors
flying
into
the
fort
if
the
enemy
makes
a
stand
i
should
think
it
would
be
at
the
ford
seems
likely
come
come
dave
be
cheerful
if
they
meet
us
at
the
ford
or
anywhere
else
well
brush
em
aside
that
big
body
of
french
regulars
from
canada
hasnt
comewe
know
thatand
there
isnt
force
enough
in
duquesne
to
withstand
us
willet
did
not
say
anything
more
but
his
steps
were
not
at
all
buoyant
as
they
walked
back
toward
the
camp
robert
lying
on
a
blanket
slept
soundly
before
one
of
the
fires
but
awoke
at
dawn
and
took
breakfast
with
willet
tayoga
grosvenor
and
the
two
young
virginians
stuart
and
cabell
well
be
in
duquesne
tonight
said
the
sanguine
stuart
in
very
truth
we
will
said
the
equally
confident
grosvenor
the
dawn
came
clear
and
brilliant
and
the
army
advanced
to
the
music
of
a
fine
band
the
light
cavalry
led
the
way
then
came
a
detachment
of
sailors
who
had
been
loaned
by
admiral
keppel
followed
by
the
english
regulars
in
red
and
the
virginians
in
blue
behind
them
came
the
cannon
the
packhorses
and
all
the
elements
that
make
up
the
train
of
an
army
it
was
a
gay
and
inspiriting
sight
especially
so
to
youth
and
roberts
heart
thrilled
as
he
looked
the
hour
of
triumph
had
come
at
last
away
with
the
forebodings
of
willet
here
was
the
might
of
england
and
the
colonies
and
brave
and
cunning
as
st
luc
and
beaujeu
and
the
other
frenchmen
might
be
their
bravery
and
cunning
would
avail
them
nothing
they
marched
on
all
the
morning
a
long
and
brilliant
line
of
red
and
blue
and
brown
and
nothing
happened
the
forest
on
either
side
of
them
was
still
silent
and
tenantless
and
they
expected
in
a
few
more
hours
to
see
the
fort
they
had
come
so
far
to
take
the
heavens
themselves
were
propitious
only
little
white
clouds
were
to
be
seen
in
the
sky
of
dazzling
blue
and
the
green
forest
stirred
by
a
gentle
wind
waved
its
boughs
at
them
in
friendly
fashion
about
noon
they
approached
the
river
and
gage
leading
a
strong
advance
guard
across
it
found
no
enemy
on
the
other
side
puzzling
and
also
pleasing
news
the
foe
whom
they
had
expected
to
find
in
this
formidable
position
seemed
to
have
melted
away
no
trace
of
him
could
be
found
in
the
forest
and
to
many
it
appeared
that
the
road
to
fort
duquesne
lay
open
theyve
concluded
our
force
is
too
great
and
have
abandoned
the
fort
said
robert
i
cant
make
anything
else
of
it
dave
it
does
look
like
it
said
the
hunter
doubtfully
i
certainly
thought
they
would
meet
us
here
the
ford
is
the
place
of
places
for
a
defensive
battle
gage
made
his
report
to
braddock
confirming
the
general
in
his
belief
that
the
french
and
indians
would
not
dare
to
meet
him
and
that
the
dangers
of
the
wilderness
had
been
overrated
the
order
to
resume
the
march
was
given
and
the
trumpets
in
the
advance
sang
merrily
the
silent
woods
giving
back
their
echoes
in
faint
musical
notes
the
afternoon
that
had
now
come
was
as
brilliant
as
the
morning
a
great
sun
blazed
down
from
a
sky
of
cloudless
blue
deepening
and
intensifying
the
green
of
the
forest
the
red
uniforms
of
the
british
and
the
blue
uniforms
of
the
virginians
robert
again
admired
the
sight
the
army
marched
as
if
on
parade
and
it
presented
a
splendid
spectacle
the
head
of
the
column
entered
the
shallows
and
soon
the
long
line
was
passing
the
river
robert
had
a
lingering
belief
that
the
bullets
would
rain
upon
them
in
the
water
but
nothing
stirred
in
the
forest
beyond
the
head
of
the
column
emerged
upon
the
opposite
bank
and
then
its
long
red
and
blue
length
trailed
slowly
after
robert
and
his
comrades
crossed
in
a
wagon
they
had
wanted
to
go
into
the
woods
seeking
for
the
enemy
but
the
orders
of
braddock
who
wished
to
keep
all
his
force
together
held
them
the
entire
army
was
now
across
and
within
the
shade
of
the
forest
the
general
ordered
a
short
period
for
rest
and
food
before
they
completed
the
few
miles
that
yet
separated
them
from
fort
duquesne
the
troops
were
in
great
spirits
they
might
have
been
held
at
the
dangerous
ford
they
thought
but
now
that
it
had
been
passed
without
resistance
the
woods
could
offer
nothing
able
to
stop
them
what
has
become
of
your
warlike
frenchmen
mr
willet
asked
grosvenor
so
far
as
this
campaign
is
concerned
they
seem
to
excel
as
runners
rather
than
warriors
i
confess
that
im
surprised
mr
grosvenor
replied
the
hunter
beaujeu
st
luc
and
dumas
are
not
the
men
to
make
a
carpet
of
roses
for
us
to
march
on
there
is
something
here
that
does
not
meet
the
eye
what
say
you
tayoga
i
like
it
not
replied
the
onondaga
in
war
i
fear
the
forest
when
it
is
silent
near
them
a
small
circle
of
land
had
been
cleared
and
in
it
stood
a
house
lone
and
deserted
it
had
been
built
by
a
trader
named
fraser
and
in
it
washington
who
had
visited
it
once
before
on
a
former
mission
and
one
or
two
others
sat
during
the
period
of
rest
and
refreshment
the
young
virginian
despite
his
great
frame
and
gigantic
strength
was
so
much
wasted
by
fever
that
when
he
came
forth
to
remount
he
was
barely
able
to
keep
his
place
in
his
saddle
now
the
merry
trumpets
sang
again
and
the
red
and
blue
column
lifting
itself
up
resumed
its
march
along
the
trail
through
the
forest
toward
duquesne
the
river
was
on
one
side
and
a
line
of
high
hills
on
the
other
but
the
forest
everywhere
was
dense
and
in
its
heaviest
foliage
braddock
despite
the
safe
passage
of
the
ford
was
not
reckless
a
troop
of
guides
and
virginia
light
horsemen
led
the
way
a
hundred
yards
behind
them
came
the
vanguard
then
gage
with
a
picked
body
of
british
troops
after
them
the
axmen
who
had
done
such
great
work
behind
them
the
main
body
of
the
artillery
the
wagons
and
the
packhorses
while
a
strong
force
of
regulars
and
virginians
closed
up
the
rear
scouts
and
skirmishers
ranged
the
flanks
though
they
were
ordered
to
go
not
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
away
robert
tayoga
and
willet
were
with
the
guides
at
the
very
apex
of
the
column
and
they
continually
searched
the
forests
and
the
thickets
with
keen
eyes
for
a
possible
enemy
but
all
was
quiet
there
the
game
frightened
by
the
advancing
army
had
gone
away
not
a
leaf
not
a
bough
stirred
the
blazing
sun
now
near
the
zenith
poured
down
fiery
rays
and
it
was
hot
in
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
that
grew
so
closely
together
robert
and
the
other
scouts
and
guides
in
the
apex
marched
on
soundless
feet
but
he
heard
close
behind
him
the
tread
of
the
virginia
light
horsemen
behind
them
the
steady
march
of
the
regulars
under
gage
and
behind
them
the
deep
hum
and
murmur
of
the
army
the
creaking
of
wheels
and
the
clank
of
the
great
guns
despite
the
following
sounds
he
was
conscious
all
the
time
of
the
deep
intense
silence
in
the
forest
on
either
side
of
him
the
birds
like
the
game
had
gone
away
and
there
was
no
flash
of
blue
or
of
flame
among
the
green
leaves
theres
a
dip
just
ahead
said
willet
pointing
to
a
wide
ravine
filled
with
bushes
that
ran
directly
across
the
trail
they
continued
their
steady
advance
and
roberts
heart
fluttered
but
when
they
came
to
the
ravine
they
found
it
empty
of
everything
save
the
bushes
and
the
scouts
and
guides
plunging
into
it
crossed
to
the
other
side
the
light
horsemen
of
virginia
followed
after
them
gages
regulars
and
then
the
main
army
drew
on
its
red
and
blue
length
expecting
to
cross
in
the
same
way
robert
tayoga
and
willet
leading
entered
the
deep
forest
again
some
chance
had
put
young
lennox
slightly
in
advance
of
his
comrades
but
suddenly
he
stopped
a
short
distance
ahead
a
figure
bounded
across
the
trail
and
disappeared
in
the
thicket
it
was
only
a
flitting
glimpse
but
he
recognized
st
luc
the
athletic
figure
the
fair
hair
and
the
strong
face
st
luc
he
exclaimed
did
you
see
dave
did
you
see
aye
i
saw
said
the
hunter
and
the
enemy
is
here
he
whirled
about
threw
up
his
arms
and
shouted
to
the
column
to
stop
at
the
same
moment
a
terrible
cry
the
long
fierce
war
whoop
of
the
savages
burst
from
the
forest
filled
the
air
and
came
back
in
ferocious
echoes
then
a
deadly
fire
of
rifles
and
muskets
was
poured
from
both
right
and
left
upon
the
marching
column
men
and
horses
went
down
and
cries
of
pain
and
surprise
blended
with
the
war
whoop
of
the
savages
which
swelled
and
fell
again
robert
and
his
comrades
had
thrown
themselves
flat
upon
the
ground
at
the
first
fire
and
escaped
the
bullets
now
they
rose
to
their
knees
and
began
to
send
their
own
bullets
at
the
flitting
forms
among
the
trees
and
bushes
robert
caught
glimpses
of
the
savages
naked
to
the
waist
coated
thickly
with
war
paint
their
fierce
eyes
gleaming
and
now
and
then
he
saw
a
man
in
french
uniform
passing
among
them
and
encouraging
them
he
saw
one
gigantic
figure
which
he
knew
to
be
that
of
tandakora
and
he
raised
his
reloaded
rifle
to
fire
at
him
but
the
ojibway
was
gone
surprised
in
the
ominous
forest
the
british
and
the
virginians
nevertheless
showed
a
courage
worthy
of
all
praise
gage
formed
his
regulars
on
the
trail
and
they
sent
volley
after
volley
into
the
dense
shades
on
either
side
the
big
muskets
thundering
together
like
cannon
leaves
and
twigs
and
little
boughs
fell
in
showers
before
their
bullets
but
whether
they
struck
any
of
the
foe
they
did
not
know
the
smoke
soon
rose
in
clouds
and
added
to
the
dimness
and
obscurity
of
the
forest
a
great
noise
shouted
tayoga
in
roberts
ear
but
it
does
not
hurt
the
enemy
who
sees
his
target
and
sends
his
bullets
against
it
the
soldiers
were
dropping
fast
and
the
bullets
of
the
french
and
the
savages
were
coming
from
their
coverts
in
a
deadly
rain
robert
willet
and
tayoga
with
the
wisdom
of
the
wilderness
remained
crouched
at
the
edge
of
the
trail
but
in
shelter
and
did
not
fire
until
they
saw
an
enemy
upon
whom
to
draw
the
trigger
then
a
deeper
roar
was
added
to
the
thundering
of
the
big
muskets
as
braddock
brought
up
the
cannon
and
they
began
to
sweep
the
forest
the
english
troops
eager
to
get
at
the
foe
crowded
forward
shouting
god
save
the
king
and
the
cheers
of
the
virginians
joined
with
them
well
win
well
win
cried
robert
they
cant
stop
such
brave
men
as
ours
but
the
fire
of
the
french
and
the
savages
was
increasing
in
volume
and
accuracy
the
bullets
and
cannon
balls
of
the
english
and
americans
fired
almost
at
random
were
passing
over
their
heads
but
the
great
column
of
scarlet
and
blue
on
the
trail
formed
a
target
which
the
leaden
missiles
could
not
miss
continually
shouting
the
war
whoop
exultant
now
with
the
joy
of
expected
triumph
the
savages
hovered
on
either
flank
of
braddocks
army
like
a
swarm
of
bees
but
with
a
sting
far
more
deadly
the
brave
and
wily
beaujeu
had
been
killed
in
the
first
minute
of
the
battle
but
st
luc
dumas
and
ligneris
equally
brave
and
wily
directed
the
onset
and
the
huge
tandakora
raged
before
his
warriors
the
head
of
the
british
column
was
destroyed
and
the
three
crept
back
toward
gages
regulars
but
the
fire
of
the
enemy
was
now
spreading
along
both
flanks
of
the
column
to
its
full
length
robert
remembered
the
warning
words
of
st
luc
every
twig
and
leaf
in
the
forest
was
spouting
death
gages
regulars
raked
by
a
terrible
fire
and
in
danger
of
complete
destruction
were
compelled
to
retreat
upon
the
main
body
and
to
their
infinite
mortification
abandon
two
cannon
which
the
savages
seized
with
fierce
shouts
of
joy
and
dragged
into
the
woods
it
goes
ill
said
willet
as
the
terrible
forest
raining
death
from
every
side
seemed
to
close
in
on
them
like
the
shadow
of
doom
braddock
hearing
the
tremendous
fire
ahead
rushed
forward
his
own
immediate
troops
as
fast
as
possible
and
meeting
gages
retreating
men
the
two
bodies
became
a
great
mass
of
scarlet
in
the
forest
upon
which
french
and
indian
bullets
that
could
not
miss
beat
like
a
storm
of
hail
the
shouts
and
cheers
of
the
regulars
ceased
in
an
appalling
situation
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
known
before
hemmed
in
on
every
side
by
an
unseen
death
they
fell
into
confusion
but
they
did
not
lose
courage
the
savage
ring
now
enclosed
the
whole
army
and
to
stand
and
to
retreat
alike
meant
death
the
british
charged
with
the
bayonet
into
the
thickets
the
indians
melted
away
before
them
and
when
the
exhausted
regulars
came
back
into
the
trail
the
indians
rushed
after
them
still
pouring
in
a
murderous
fire
and
making
the
forest
ring
with
the
ferocious
war
whoop
the
virginians
knowing
the
warfare
of
the
wilderness
began
to
take
to
the
shelter
of
the
trees
from
which
they
could
fire
at
the
enemy
the
brave
though
mistaken
braddock
fiercely
ordered
them
out
again
a
score
lying
behind
a
fallen
trunk
and
matching
the
savages
at
their
own
game
were
mistaken
by
the
regulars
for
the
foe
and
were
fired
upon
with
deadly
effect
other
regulars
who
tried
to
imitate
the
hostile
tactics
were
set
upon
by
braddock
himself
who
beat
them
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
drove
them
back
into
the
open
trail
where
the
rain
of
bullets
fell
directly
upon
them
robert
looked
upon
the
scene
and
he
found
it
awful
to
the
last
degree
the
bodies
of
the
dead
in
red
or
blue
lay
everywhere
officers
english
and
virginian
ran
here
and
there
begging
and
praying
their
troops
to
stand
and
form
in
order
fire
upon
the
enemy
they
shouted
show
us
somebody
to
fire
at
and
well
fire
the
men
shouted
back
the
confusion
was
deepening
and
the
signs
of
a
panic
were
appearing
in
the
forest
the
circle
of
indians
mad
with
battle
and
the
greatest
taking
of
scalps
they
had
ever
known
pressed
closer
and
closer
and
sent
sheets
of
bullets
into
the
huddled
mass
many
of
them
leaped
in
and
scalped
the
fallen
before
the
eyes
of
the
horrified
soldiers
the
yelling
never
ceased
and
it
was
so
terrific
that
the
few
british
officers
who
survived
declared
that
they
would
never
forget
it
to
their
dying
day
among
the
officers
the
mortality
was
now
frightful
the
brave
sir
peter
halket
was
shot
dead
and
his
young
son
the
lieutenant
rushing
to
raise
up
his
body
was
killed
and
fell
by
his
side
the
youthful
shirley
braddocks
secretary
received
a
bullet
in
his
brain
and
died
instantly
out
of
eightysix
officers
sixtythree
were
down
washington
alone
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
two
horses
were
killed
under
him
and
four
bullets
pierced
his
clothing
braddock
galloped
back
and
forth
cursing
and
shouting
to
his
men
and
showing
undaunted
courage
robert
believed
that
he
never
really
understood
what
was
happening
that
the
deadly
nature
of
the
surprise
and
its
appalling
completeness
left
him
dazed
how
long
robert
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
of
death
and
fired
into
the
bushes
he
never
knew
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
almost
an
eternity
had
passed
when
tayoga
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
shouted
in
his
ear
it
is
finished
our
army
has
perished
come
lennox
he
wiped
the
smoke
from
his
eyes
and
saw
that
the
mass
in
red
and
blue
was
much
smaller
braddock
was
still
on
his
horse
and
at
the
insistence
of
his
officers
he
was
at
last
giving
the
command
to
retreat
just
as
the
trumpet
sounded
that
note
of
defeat
he
was
shot
through
the
body
and
fell
to
the
ground
where
in
his
rage
and
despair
he
begged
the
men
to
leave
him
to
die
alone
but
two
of
the
virginia
officers
lifted
him
up
and
bore
him
toward
the
rear
then
the
army
that
had
fought
so
long
against
an
invisible
foe
broke
into
a
panic
that
is
what
was
left
of
it
as
two
thirds
of
its
numbers
had
already
been
killed
or
wounded
shouting
with
horror
and
ignoring
their
officers
they
rushed
for
the
river
everything
was
lost
cannon
and
baggage
were
abandoned
and
often
rifles
and
muskets
were
thrown
away
into
the
water
they
rushed
and
the
indians
who
had
followed
howling
like
wolves
stopped
though
they
fired
at
the
fleeing
men
in
the
stream
as
the
retreat
began
robert
tayoga
and
willet
whom
some
miracle
seemed
to
preserve
from
harm
joined
the
virginians
who
covered
the
rear
and
as
fast
as
they
could
reload
their
rifles
they
fired
at
the
demon
horde
that
pressed
closer
and
closer
and
that
never
ceased
to
cut
down
the
fleeing
army
it
was
much
like
a
ghastly
dream
to
robert
nothing
was
real
except
his
overwhelming
sense
of
horror
men
fell
around
him
and
he
wondered
why
he
did
not
fall
too
but
he
was
untouched
and
willet
and
tayoga
also
were
unwounded
he
saw
near
him
young
stuart
who
had
lost
his
horse
long
since
but
who
had
snatched
a
rifle
from
a
fallen
soldier
and
who
was
fighting
gallantly
on
foot
who
would
have
thought
it
exclaimed
the
virginian
an
army
such
as
ours
to
be
beaten
nay
to
be
destroyed
by
a
swarm
of
savages
but
dont
forget
the
frenchmen
shouted
robert
in
reply
theyre
directing
which
is
no
consolation
to
us
cried
stuart
he
said
something
else
but
it
was
lost
in
the
tremendous
firing
and
yelling
of
the
indians
who
were
now
only
a
score
of
yards
away
from
the
devoted
rear
guard
that
was
doing
its
best
to
protect
the
flying
and
confused
mass
of
soldiers
robert
discharged
his
bullet
at
a
brown
face
and
then
as
he
walked
backward
he
tripped
and
fell
over
a
root
he
sprang
up
at
once
but
in
an
instant
a
gigantic
figure
bounded
out
of
the
fire
and
smoke
and
tandakora
uttering
a
fierce
shout
of
triumph
circled
his
tomahawk
swiftly
above
his
head
preparatory
to
the
mortal
blow
but
tayoga
quick
as
lightning
hurled
his
pistol
with
all
his
might
it
struck
the
huge
ojibway
on
the
head
with
such
force
that
the
tomahawk
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
staggered
back
into
the
smoke
tayoga
again
i
thank
you
cried
robert
you
will
do
the
same
for
me
said
the
onondaga
and
then
they
too
were
lost
in
the
smoke
as
with
the
rear
guard
of
virginians
they
followed
the
retreating
army
robert
and
his
comrades
swept
on
in
the
press
crossed
the
river
with
the
others
and
gained
the
farther
shore
unhurt
willet
looked
back
at
the
woods
which
still
flamed
with
the
hostile
rifles
and
shuddered
its
worse
than
anything
of
which
i
ever
dreamed
he
said
now
the
tomahawk
and
the
scalping
knife
will
sweep
the
border
from
canada
to
carolina
the
panic
was
stopped
at
last
and
the
broken
remnants
of
the
army
covered
by
the
virginians
who
understood
the
forest
began
their
retreat
braddock
died
the
next
day
his
last
words
being
we
shall
know
better
how
to
deal
with
them
another
time
washington
orme
morris
and
the
others
carried
the
news
of
the
great
defeat
to
virginia
and
pennsylvania
whence
it
was
sent
to
england
to
be
received
there
at
first
with
incredulity
men
saying
that
such
a
thing
was
impossible
but
england
too
was
soon
to
be
in
mourning
because
so
many
of
her
bravest
had
fallen
at
the
hands
of
an
invisible
foe
in
the
far
american
wilderness
robert
willet
and
tayoga
followed
the
retreating
army
only
a
short
distance
beyond
the
monongahela
they
saw
that
grosvenor
stuart
and
cabell
had
escaped
with
slight
wounds
and
slipping
quietly
into
the
forest
they
circled
about
fort
duquesne
seeing
the
lights
where
the
indians
were
burning
their
wretched
prisoners
alive
and
then
plunging
again
into
the
woods
late
at
night
they
lay
down
in
a
dense
covert
and
exhausted
slept
they
rose
at
dawn
and
tried
to
shake
off
the
horror
be
of
good
courage
robert
said
willet
its
a
terrible
blow
but
england
and
the
colonies
have
not
yet
gathered
their
full
strength
that
is
so
said
tayoga
our
sachems
tell
us
that
he
who
wins
the
first
victory
does
not
always
win
the
last
a
bird
on
a
bough
over
their
heads
began
to
sing
a
song
of
greeting
to
the
new
day
and
robert
hoped
and
believed
