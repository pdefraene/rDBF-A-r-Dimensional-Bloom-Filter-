chapter
i
the
onondaga
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
advanced
with
utmost
caution
through
a
forest
so
thick
with
undergrowth
that
it
hid
all
objects
twenty
yards
away
he
was
not
armed
with
a
rifle
but
carried
instead
a
heavy
bow
while
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
hung
over
his
shoulder
he
wore
less
clothing
than
when
he
was
in
the
white
mans
school
at
albany
his
arms
and
shoulders
being
bare
though
not
painted
the
young
indians
aspect
too
had
changed
the
great
struggle
between
english
and
french
drawing
with
it
the
whole
north
american
wilderness
had
begun
and
although
the
fifty
sachems
still
sought
to
hold
the
six
nations
neutral
many
of
their
bravest
warriors
were
already
serving
with
the
americans
and
english
ranging
the
forest
as
scouts
and
guides
and
skirmishers
bringing
to
the
campaign
an
unrivaled
skill
and
a
faith
sealed
by
the
long
alliance
tayoga
had
thrown
himself
into
the
war
heart
and
soul
nothing
could
diminish
by
a
hair
his
hostility
to
the
french
and
the
tribes
allied
with
them
the
deeds
of
champlain
and
frontenac
were
but
of
yesterday
and
the
nation
to
which
they
belonged
could
never
be
a
friend
of
the
hodenosaunee
he
trusted
the
americans
and
the
english
but
his
chief
devotion
by
the
decree
of
nature
was
for
his
own
people
and
now
that
fighting
in
the
forest
had
occurred
between
the
rival
nations
he
shed
more
of
the
white
ways
and
became
a
true
son
of
the
wilderness
seeing
as
red
men
saw
and
thinking
as
red
men
thought
he
was
bent
over
a
little
as
he
walked
slowly
among
the
bushes
in
the
position
of
one
poised
for
instant
flight
or
pursuit
as
the
need
might
be
his
eyes
black
and
piercing
ranged
about
incessantly
nothing
escaping
a
vision
so
keen
and
trained
so
thoroughly
that
he
not
only
heard
everything
passing
in
the
wilderness
but
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
sound
and
what
had
made
it
the
kindly
look
that
distinguished
tayoga
in
repose
had
disappeared
unnumbered
generations
were
speaking
in
him
now
and
the
indian
often
so
gentle
in
peace
had
become
his
usual
self
stern
and
unrelenting
in
war
his
strong
sharp
chin
was
thrust
forward
his
cheek
bones
seemed
to
be
a
little
higher
his
tread
was
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
bent
before
his
moccasins
and
no
leaves
rustled
he
was
in
every
respect
the
wilderness
hunter
and
warrior
fitted
perfectly
by
the
supreme
hand
into
his
setting
and
if
an
enemy
appeared
now
he
would
fight
as
his
people
had
fought
for
centuries
and
the
customs
and
feelings
of
the
new
races
that
had
come
across
the
ocean
would
be
nothing
to
him
a
hundred
yards
more
and
he
sat
down
by
the
trunk
of
a
great
oak
convinced
that
no
foe
was
near
his
own
five
splendid
senses
had
told
him
so
and
the
fact
had
been
confirmed
by
an
unrivaled
sentinel
hidden
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
a
small
bird
that
poured
forth
a
wonderful
volume
of
song
were
any
other
coming
the
bird
would
cease
his
melody
and
fly
away
but
tayoga
felt
that
this
tiny
feathered
being
was
his
ally
and
would
not
leave
because
of
him
the
song
had
wonderful
power
too
soothing
his
senses
and
casting
a
pleasing
spell
his
imaginative
mind
infused
with
the
religion
and
beliefs
of
his
ancestors
filled
the
forest
with
friendly
spirits
unseen
they
hovered
in
the
air
and
watched
over
him
and
the
trees
alive
bent
protecting
boughs
toward
him
he
saw
too
the
very
spot
in
the
heavens
where
the
great
shining
star
on
which
tododaho
lived
came
out
at
night
and
glittered
he
remembered
the
time
when
he
had
gone
forth
in
the
dusk
to
meet
tandakora
and
his
friends
and
how
tododaho
had
looked
down
on
him
with
approval
he
had
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
the
great
leagues
founder
and
the
spirit
that
dwelt
on
the
shining
star
still
watched
over
him
the
ojibway
whom
he
hated
and
who
hated
him
in
yet
greater
measure
might
be
somewhere
in
the
forest
but
if
he
came
near
the
feathered
sentinel
among
the
leaves
over
his
head
would
give
warning
tayoga
sat
nearly
half
an
hour
listening
to
the
song
of
the
bird
he
had
no
object
in
remaining
there
his
errand
bade
him
move
on
but
there
was
no
hurry
and
he
was
content
merely
to
breathe
and
to
feel
the
glory
and
splendor
of
the
forest
about
him
he
knew
now
that
the
indian
nature
had
never
been
taken
out
of
him
by
the
schools
he
loved
the
wilderness
the
trees
the
lakes
the
streams
and
all
their
magnificent
disorder
and
war
itself
did
not
greatly
trouble
him
since
the
legends
of
the
tribes
made
it
the
natural
state
of
man
he
knew
well
that
he
was
in
tododahos
keeping
and
if
by
chance
the
great
chief
should
turn
against
him
it
would
be
for
some
grave
fault
and
he
would
deserve
his
punishment
he
sat
in
that
absolute
stillness
of
which
the
indian
by
nature
and
training
was
capable
the
green
of
his
tanned
and
beautifully
soft
deerskin
blending
so
perfectly
with
the
emerald
hue
of
the
foliage
that
the
bird
above
his
head
at
last
took
him
for
a
part
of
the
forest
itself
and
so
having
no
fear
came
down
within
a
foot
of
his
head
and
sang
with
more
ecstasy
than
ever
it
was
a
little
gray
bird
but
tayoga
knew
that
often
the
smaller
a
bird
was
and
the
more
sober
its
plumage
the
finer
was
its
song
he
understood
those
musical
notes
too
they
expressed
sheer
delight
the
joy
of
life
just
as
he
felt
it
then
himself
and
the
kinship
between
the
two
was
strong
the
bird
at
last
flew
away
and
the
onondaga
heard
its
song
dying
among
the
distant
leaves
a
portion
of
the
forest
spell
departed
with
it
and
tayoga
returning
to
thoughts
of
his
task
rose
and
walked
on
instinct
rather
than
will
causing
him
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
earth
and
foliage
when
he
saw
the
faint
trace
of
a
large
moccasin
on
the
earth
all
that
was
left
of
the
spell
departed
suddenly
and
he
became
at
once
the
wilderness
warrior
active
alert
ready
to
read
every
sign
he
studied
the
imprint
which
turned
in
and
hence
had
been
made
by
an
indian
its
great
size
too
indicated
to
him
that
it
might
be
that
of
tandakora
a
belief
becoming
with
him
almost
a
certainty
as
he
found
other
and
similar
traces
farther
on
he
followed
them
about
a
mile
reaching
stony
ground
where
they
vanished
altogether
and
then
he
turned
to
the
west
the
fact
that
tandakora
was
so
near
and
might
approach
again
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
as
tayoga
having
all
the
soul
of
a
warrior
was
anxious
to
match
himself
with
the
gigantic
ojibway
and
since
the
war
was
now
active
on
the
border
it
seemed
that
the
opportunity
might
come
but
his
attention
must
be
occupied
with
something
else
for
the
present
and
he
went
toward
the
west
for
a
full
hour
through
the
primeval
forest
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
listen
even
lying
down
and
putting
his
ear
to
the
ground
but
the
sounds
he
heard
although
varied
and
many
were
natural
to
the
wild
he
knew
them
all
the
steady
tapping
was
a
woodpecker
at
work
upon
an
old
tree
the
faint
musical
note
was
another
little
gray
bird
singing
the
delight
of
his
soul
as
he
perched
himself
upon
a
twig
the
light
shuffling
noise
was
the
tread
of
a
bear
hunting
succulent
nuts
a
cawcaw
so
distant
that
it
was
like
an
echo
was
the
voice
of
a
circling
crow
and
the
tiny
trickling
noise
that
only
the
keenest
ear
could
have
heard
was
made
by
a
brook
a
yard
wide
taking
a
terrific
plunge
over
a
precipice
six
inches
high
the
rustling
one
great
blended
note
universal
but
soft
was
that
of
the
leaves
moving
in
harmony
before
the
gentle
wind
the
young
onondaga
was
sure
that
the
forest
held
no
alien
presence
the
traces
of
tandakora
were
hours
old
and
he
must
now
be
many
miles
away
with
his
band
and
such
being
the
case
it
was
fit
time
for
him
to
choose
a
camp
and
call
his
friends
it
pleased
tayoga
zealous
of
mind
to
do
all
the
work
before
the
others
came
and
treading
so
lightly
and
delicately
that
he
would
not
have
alarmed
a
rabbit
in
the
bush
he
gathered
together
dead
sticks
and
heaped
them
in
a
little
sunken
place
clear
of
undergrowth
flint
and
steel
soon
lighted
a
fire
and
then
he
sent
forth
his
call
the
long
penetrating
whine
of
the
wolf
the
reply
came
from
the
north
and
building
his
fire
a
little
higher
he
awaited
the
result
without
anxiety
the
dry
wood
crackled
and
many
little
flames
red
or
yellow
arose
tayoga
heaped
dead
leaves
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
sat
down
comfortably
his
shoulders
and
back
resting
against
the
bark
presently
he
heard
the
first
alien
sound
in
the
forest
a
light
tread
approaching
that
he
knew
was
willet
and
then
he
heard
the
second
tread
even
lighter
than
the
first
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
footstep
of
robert
all
ready
its
like
you
tayoga
said
willet
as
he
entered
the
open
space
here
you
are
with
the
house
built
and
the
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
i
lighted
the
fire
said
tayoga
rising
but
manitou
made
the
hearth
and
built
the
house
which
is
worthy
of
him
he
looked
with
admiration
at
the
magnificent
trees
spreading
away
on
every
side
and
the
foliage
in
its
most
splendid
new
luxuriant
green
it
is
worthy
tayoga
said
robert
whose
soul
was
like
that
of
the
onondaga
and
it
takes
manitou
himself
a
century
or
more
to
grow
trees
like
these
some
of
them
i
dare
say
are
three
or
four
hundred
years
old
or
more
said
willet
and
the
forest
goes
west
so
ive
heard
the
indians
say
a
matter
of
near
two
thousand
miles
its
pleasant
to
know
that
if
all
the
axes
in
the
world
were
at
work
it
couldnt
all
be
cut
down
in
our
time
or
in
the
time
of
our
children
tayogas
heart
swelled
with
indignation
at
the
idea
that
the
forest
might
be
destroyed
but
he
said
nothing
as
he
knew
that
willet
and
robert
shared
his
feeling
heres
your
rifle
tayoga
said
the
hunter
i
suppose
you
didnt
have
an
occasion
to
use
your
bow
and
arrows
no
great
bear
replied
the
onondaga
but
i
might
have
had
the
chance
had
i
come
earlier
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
saw
on
the
grass
a
human
trace
it
was
made
by
a
foot
clothed
in
a
moccasin
a
large
foot
a
very
large
foot
the
foot
of
a
man
whom
we
all
have
cause
to
hate
i
take
it
youre
speaking
of
tandakora
the
ojibway
none
other
i
cannot
be
mistaken
but
the
trail
was
cold
he
and
his
warriors
have
gone
north
they
may
be
thirty
forty
miles
from
here
likely
enough
tayoga
theyre
on
their
way
to
join
the
force
the
french
are
sending
to
the
fort
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
and
the
alleghany
perhaps
st
lucand
there
isnt
a
cleverer
officer
in
this
continentis
with
them
i
tell
you
tayoga
and
you
too
robert
i
dont
like
it
that
young
washington
ought
to
have
been
sent
earlier
into
the
ohio
country
and
they
should
have
given
him
a
much
larger
force
were
sluggards
and
all
our
governors
are
sluggards
except
maybe
shirley
of
massachusetts
with
the
war
just
blazing
up
the
french
are
already
in
possession
and
were
to
drive
em
out
which
doubles
our
task
it
was
a
great
victory
for
us
to
keep
the
hodenosaunee
on
our
side
or
in
the
main
neutral
but
its
going
to
be
uphill
work
for
us
to
win
the
young
french
leaders
are
genuine
kings
of
the
wilderness
you
know
that
robert
as
well
as
i
do
yes
said
the
youth
i
know
theyre
the
men
whom
the
english
colonies
have
good
cause
to
fear
when
he
spoke
he
was
thinking
of
st
luc
as
he
had
last
seen
him
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
defeated
in
the
appeal
to
the
fifty
sachems
but
gallant
well
bred
showing
nothing
of
chagrin
and
sure
to
be
a
formidable
foe
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
an
enemy
of
whom
one
could
be
proud
and
robert
felt
an
actual
wish
to
see
him
again
even
though
in
opposing
ranks
we
may
come
into
contact
with
some
of
em
said
the
hunter
the
french
are
using
all
their
influence
over
the
indians
and
are
directing
their
movements
i
know
that
st
luc
jumonville
beaujeu
dumas
de
villiers
de
courcelles
and
all
their
best
men
are
in
the
forest
its
likely
that
tandakora
fierce
and
wild
as
he
is
is
acting
under
the
direction
of
some
frenchman
st
luc
could
control
him
robert
thought
it
highly
probable
that
the
chevalier
was
in
truth
with
the
indians
on
the
border
either
leading
some
daring
band
or
gathering
the
warriors
to
the
banner
of
france
his
influence
with
them
would
be
great
as
he
understood
their
ways
adapted
himself
to
them
and
showed
in
battle
a
skill
and
daring
that
always
make
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
savage
heart
the
youth
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
in
the
test
of
words
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
now
he
felt
that
he
must
match
himself
anew
but
in
the
test
of
forest
war
tayoga
having
lighted
the
fire
the
hunter
cooked
the
food
over
it
while
the
two
youths
reposed
calmly
robert
watched
willet
with
interest
and
he
was
impressed
for
the
thousandth
time
by
his
great
strength
and
the
lightness
of
his
movements
when
he
was
younger
the
disparity
in
years
had
made
him
think
of
willet
as
an
old
man
but
he
saw
now
that
he
was
only
in
early
middle
age
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
on
his
head
and
his
face
was
free
from
wrinkles
an
extraordinarily
vivid
memory
of
that
night
in
quebec
when
the
hunter
had
faced
boucher
the
bully
and
bravo
reputed
the
best
swordsman
of
france
leaped
up
in
roberts
mind
he
had
found
no
time
to
think
of
willets
past
recently
and
he
realized
now
that
he
knew
little
about
it
the
origin
of
that
hunter
was
as
obscure
as
his
own
but
the
story
of
the
past
and
its
mysteries
must
wait
the
present
was
so
great
and
overwhelming
that
it
blotted
out
everything
else
the
venison
and
the
bacon
are
ready
said
willet
and
you
two
lads
can
fall
on
youre
not
what
id
call
epicures
but
ive
never
known
your
appetites
to
fail
nor
will
they
said
robert
as
he
and
tayoga
helped
themselves
whats
the
news
from
britain
dave
you
must
have
heard
a
lot
when
you
were
in
albany
its
vague
robert
vague
the
english
are
slow
just
as
we
americans
are
too
theyre
going
to
send
out
troops
but
the
french
have
dispatched
a
fleet
and
regiments
already
the
fact
that
our
colonies
are
so
much
larger
than
theirs
is
perhaps
an
advantage
to
them
as
it
gives
them
a
bigger
target
to
aim
at
and
our
people
who
are
trying
to
till
their
farms
will
be
struck
down
by
their
indians
from
ambush
and
you
see
now
what
a
bulwark
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
is
to
the
english
said
tayoga
a
fact
that
ive
always
foreseen
said
willet
warmly
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
the
power
of
the
six
nations
and
nobody
has
ever
been
readier
to
admit
it
i
know
great
bear
you
have
always
been
our
true
friend
if
all
the
white
men
were
like
you
no
trouble
would
ever
arise
between
them
and
the
hodenosaunee
robert
finished
his
food
and
resumed
a
comfortable
place
against
a
tree
willet
put
out
the
fire
and
he
and
tayoga
sat
down
in
like
fashion
their
trees
were
close
together
but
they
did
not
talk
now
each
was
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
robert
had
much
to
think
about
the
war
was
going
slowly
he
had
believed
a
great
flare
would
come
at
once
and
that
everybody
would
soon
be
in
the
thick
of
action
but
since
young
washington
had
been
defeated
by
coulon
de
villiers
at
the
great
meadows
the
british
colonies
had
spent
much
time
debating
and
pulling
in
different
directions
the
union
for
which
his
eager
soul
craved
did
not
come
and
the
shadow
of
the
french
power
in
the
north
reinforced
by
innumerable
savages
hung
heavy
and
black
over
the
land
every
runner
brought
news
of
french
activities
rumor
painted
as
impregnable
the
fort
they
had
built
where
two
rivers
uniting
formed
the
ohio
and
it
was
certain
that
many
bands
already
ranged
down
in
the
regions
the
english
called
their
own
spring
had
lingered
far
into
summer
where
they
were
and
the
foliage
was
not
yet
touched
by
heat
all
the
forest
was
in
deep
and
heavy
green
hiding
every
object
a
hundred
yards
away
but
from
their
opening
they
saw
a
blue
and
speckless
sky
which
the
three
by
and
by
watched
attentively
and
with
the
same
motive
before
the
dark
had
begun
to
come
in
the
east
they
saw
a
thin
dark
line
drawn
slowly
across
it
the
trail
of
smoke
it
might
not
have
been
noticed
by
eyes
less
keen
but
they
understood
at
once
that
it
was
a
signal
robert
noted
its
drifting
progress
across
the
heavens
and
then
he
said
to
willet
how
far
from
here
do
you
calculate
the
base
of
that
smoke
is
dave
a
long
distance
robert
several
miles
maybe
the
fire
ive
no
doubt
was
kindled
on
top
of
a
hill
it
may
be
french
speaking
to
indians
or
indians
talking
to
indians
and
you
dont
think
its
people
of
ours
im
sure
it
isnt
weve
no
hunters
or
runners
in
these
parts
except
ourselves
and
its
not
tandakora
said
the
onondaga
he
must
be
much
farther
away
but
the
signal
may
be
intended
for
him
said
the
hunter
it
may
be
carried
to
him
by
relays
of
smoke
i
wish
i
could
read
that
trail
across
the
sky
its
thinning
out
fast
said
robert
you
can
hardly
see
it
and
now
its
gone
entirely
but
the
hunter
continued
to
look
thoughtfully
at
the
sky
where
the
smoke
had
been
he
never
underrated
the
activity
of
the
french
and
he
believed
that
a
movement
of
importance
something
the
nature
of
which
they
should
discover
was
at
hand
lads
he
said
i
expected
an
easy
night
of
good
sleep
for
all
three
of
us
but
im
thinking
instead
that
wed
better
take
to
the
trail
and
travel
toward
the
place
where
that
smoke
was
started
its
what
scouts
would
do
said
tayoga
tersely
and
such
we
claim
to
be
said
robert
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
they
saw
far
in
the
west
another
smoke
that
would
have
been
invisible
had
it
not
been
outlined
against
a
fiery
red
sky
across
which
it
lay
like
a
dark
thread
it
was
gone
in
a
few
moments
and
then
the
dusk
began
to
come
an
answer
to
the
first
signal
said
tayoga
it
is
very
likely
that
a
strong
force
is
gathering
perhaps
tandakora
has
come
back
and
is
planning
a
blow
it
cant
be
possible
that
theyre
aiming
it
at
us
said
the
hunter
thoughtfully
they
dont
know
of
our
presence
here
and
if
they
did
weve
too
small
a
party
for
such
big
preparations
perhaps
a
troop
of
pennsylvanians
are
marching
westward
said
tayoga
and
the
french
and
their
allies
are
laying
a
trap
for
them
then
said
robert
there
is
but
one
thing
for
us
to
do
we
must
warn
our
friends
and
save
them
from
the
snare
of
course
said
willet
but
we
dont
know
where
they
are
and
meanwhile
wed
better
wait
an
hour
or
two
perhaps
something
will
happen
that
will
help
us
to
locate
them
robert
and
tayoga
nodded
and
the
three
remained
silent
while
the
night
came
the
blazing
red
in
the
west
faded
rapidly
and
darkness
swept
down
over
the
wilderness
the
three
each
leaning
against
his
tree
did
not
move
but
kept
their
rifles
across
their
knees
ready
at
once
for
possible
use
tayoga
had
fastened
his
bow
over
his
back
by
the
side
of
his
quiver
and
their
packs
were
adjusted
also
robert
was
anxious
not
so
much
for
himself
as
for
the
unknown
others
who
were
marching
through
the
wilderness
and
for
whom
the
french
and
indians
were
laying
an
ambush
it
had
been
put
forward
first
as
a
suggestion
but
it
quickly
became
a
conviction
with
him
and
he
felt
that
his
comrades
and
he
must
act
as
if
it
were
a
certainty
but
no
sound
that
would
tell
them
which
way
to
go
came
out
of
this
black
forest
and
they
remained
silent
waiting
for
the
word
the
night
thickened
and
they
were
still
uncertain
what
to
do
robert
made
a
silent
prayer
to
the
god
of
the
white
man
the
manitou
of
the
red
man
for
a
sign
but
none
came
and
infected
strongly
as
he
was
with
the
indian
philosophy
and
religion
he
felt
that
it
must
be
due
to
some
lack
of
virtue
in
himself
he
searched
his
memory
but
he
could
not
discover
in
what
particular
he
had
erred
and
he
was
forced
to
continue
his
anxious
waiting
until
the
stars
should
choose
to
fight
for
him
tayoga
too
was
troubled
his
mind
in
its
own
way
being
as
active
as
roberts
he
knew
all
the
spirits
of
earth
air
and
water
were
abroad
but
he
hoped
at
least
one
of
them
would
look
upon
him
with
favor
and
give
him
a
warning
he
sought
tododahos
star
in
the
heavens
but
the
clouds
were
too
thick
and
eye
failing
he
relied
upon
his
ear
for
the
signal
which
he
and
his
young
white
comrade
sought
so
earnestly
if
tayoga
had
erred
either
in
omission
or
commission
then
the
spirits
that
hovered
about
him
forgave
him
as
when
the
night
was
thickest
they
gave
the
sign
it
was
but
the
faint
fall
of
a
foot
and
at
first
he
thought
a
bear
or
a
deer
had
made
it
but
at
the
fourth
or
fifth
fall
he
knew
that
it
was
a
human
footstep
and
he
whispered
to
his
comrades
some
one
comes
as
if
by
preconcerted
signal
the
three
arose
and
crept
silently
into
the
dense
underbrush
where
they
crouched
their
rifles
thrust
forward
it
is
but
one
man
and
he
walks
directly
toward
us
whispered
tayoga
i
hear
him
now
said
robert
he
is
wearing
moccasins
as
his
step
is
too
light
for
boots
which
means
that
hes
a
rover
like
ourselves
said
willet
now
hes
stopped
there
isnt
a
sound
the
man
whoever
he
is
has
taken
alarm
or
at
least
hes
decided
that
its
best
for
him
to
be
more
watchful
perhaps
hes
caught
a
whiff
from
the
ashes
of
our
fire
hes
white
or
he
wouldnt
be
here
alone
and
hes
used
to
the
forest
or
he
wouldnt
have
suspected
a
presence
from
so
little
the
great
bear
thinks
clearly
said
tayoga
it
is
surely
a
white
man
and
some
great
scout
or
hunter
he
moved
a
little
now
to
the
right
because
i
heard
his
buckskin
brush
lightly
against
a
bush
i
think
great
bear
is
right
about
the
fire
the
wind
has
brought
the
ashes
from
it
to
his
nostrils
and
he
will
lie
in
the
bush
long
before
moving
which
doesnt
suit
our
plans
at
all
said
willet
theres
a
chance
just
a
chance
that
i
may
know
who
he
is
white
men
of
the
kind
to
go
scouting
through
the
wilderness
are
not
so
plenty
on
the
border
that
one
has
to
make
many
guesses
you
lads
move
away
a
little
so
you
wont
be
in
line
if
a
shot
comes
and
ill
give
a
signal
robert
and
tayoga
crept
to
other
points
in
the
brush
and
the
hunter
uttered
a
whistle
low
but
very
clear
and
musical
in
a
moment
or
two
a
like
answer
came
from
a
place
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
willet
rising
advanced
without
hesitation
robert
and
tayoga
followed
promptly
and
a
tall
figure
emerging
from
the
darkness
came
forward
to
meet
them
the
stranger
was
a
man
of
middle
years
and
of
a
singularly
wild
appearance
his
eyes
roved
continually
and
were
full
of
suspicion
and
of
a
sort
of
smoldering
anger
as
if
he
had
a
grievance
against
all
the
world
his
hair
was
long
and
tangled
his
face
brown
with
sun
and
storm
and
his
dress
more
indian
than
white
he
was
heavily
armed
and
whether
seen
in
the
dusk
or
in
the
light
his
whole
aspect
was
formidable
and
dangerous
but
willet
continued
to
advance
without
hesitation
captain
jack
he
said
extending
his
hand
we
were
not
looking
for
you
tonight
but
no
man
could
be
more
welcome
these
are
young
friends
of
mine
brave
warriors
both
the
white
and
the
red
robert
lennox
who
is
almost
a
son
to
me
and
tayoga
the
onondaga
to
whom
i
feel
nearly
like
a
father
too
now
robert
knew
him
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
of
the
most
intense
curiosity
who
along
the
whole
border
had
not
heard
of
captain
jack
known
also
as
the
black
hunter
the
black
rifle
and
by
many
other
names
the
tale
had
been
told
in
every
cabin
in
the
woods
how
returning
home
he
had
found
his
wife
and
children
tomahawked
and
scalped
and
how
he
had
taken
a
vow
of
lifelong
vengeance
upon
the
indians
a
vow
most
terribly
kept
in
all
the
villages
in
the
ohio
country
and
along
the
great
lakes
the
name
of
black
rifle
was
spoken
with
awe
and
terror
no
more
singular
and
ominous
figure
ever
crossed
the
pages
of
border
story
he
swept
the
two
youths
with
questing
glances
but
they
met
his
gaze
firmly
and
while
his
eye
had
clouded
at
first
sight
of
the
onondaga
the
threatening
look
soon
passed
friends
of
yours
are
friends
of
mine
dave
willet
he
said
i
know
you
to
be
a
good
man
and
true
and
once
when
i
was
at
albany
i
heard
of
robert
lennox
and
of
the
great
young
warrior
tayoga
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
the
young
onondagas
eyes
flashed
with
pleasure
but
he
was
silent
how
does
it
happen
willet
asked
black
rifle
that
we
meet
here
in
the
forest
at
such
a
time
were
on
our
way
to
the
ohio
country
to
learn
something
about
the
gathering
of
the
french
and
indian
forces
just
before
sundown
we
saw
smoke
signals
and
we
think
our
enemies
are
planning
to
cut
off
a
force
of
ours
somewhere
here
in
the
forest
black
rifle
laughed
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
laugh
it
had
in
it
a
quality
that
made
robert
shudder
your
guesses
are
good
dave
said
black
rifle
about
fifty
men
of
the
pennsylvania
militia
are
in
camp
on
the
banks
of
a
little
creek
two
miles
from
here
they
have
been
sent
out
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
think
of
that
dave
theyre
to
be
a
guard
against
the
french
and
indians
his
face
contracted
into
a
wry
smile
and
robert
understood
his
feeling
of
derision
for
the
militia
as
i
told
you
theyre
in
camp
continued
black
rifle
they
built
a
fire
there
to
cook
their
supper
and
to
show
the
french
and
indians
where
they
are
lest
they
miss
em
in
the
darkness
they
dont
know
what
part
of
the
country
theyre
in
but
theyre
sure
its
a
long
distance
west
of
philadelphia
and
if
the
indians
will
only
tell
em
when
theyre
coming
theyll
be
ready
for
em
oh
theyre
brave
enough
theyll
probably
all
die
with
their
faces
to
the
enemy
he
spoke
with
grim
irony
and
robert
shuddered
he
knew
how
helpless
men
from
the
older
parts
of
the
country
were
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
and
he
was
sure
that
the
net
was
already
being
drawn
about
the
pennsylvanians
are
the
french
here
too
black
rifle
asked
willet
the
strange
man
pointed
toward
the
north
a
band
led
by
a
frenchman
is
there
he
replied
he
is
the
most
skillful
of
all
their
men
in
the
forest
the
one
whom
they
call
st
luc
i
thought
so
exclaimed
robert
i
believed
all
the
while
he
would
be
here
ive
no
doubt
he
will
direct
the
ambush
we
must
warn
this
troop
said
willet
and
save
em
if
they
will
let
us
you
agree
with
me
dont
you
tayoga
the
great
bear
is
right
and
youll
back
me
up
of
course
robert
will
you
help
us
too
black
rifle
the
singular
man
smiled
again
but
his
smile
was
not
like
that
of
anybody
else
it
was
sinister
and
full
of
menace
it
was
the
smile
of
a
man
who
rejoiced
in
sanguinary
work
and
it
made
robert
think
again
of
his
extraordinary
history
around
which
the
border
had
built
so
much
of
truth
and
legend
i
will
help
of
course
he
replied
its
my
trade
it
was
my
purpose
to
warn
em
before
i
met
you
but
i
feared
they
would
not
listen
to
me
now
the
words
of
four
may
sound
more
real
to
em
than
the
words
of
one
then
lead
the
way
said
willet
tis
not
a
time
to
linger
black
rifle
without
another
word
threw
his
rifle
over
his
shoulder
and
started
toward
the
north
the
others
falling
into
indian
file
behind
him
a
light
pleased
smile
played
over
his
massive
and
rugged
features
more
than
the
rest
he
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
combat
they
did
not
seek
battle
and
they
fought
only
when
they
were
compelled
to
do
so
but
he
with
his
whole
nature
embittered
forever
by
that
massacre
of
long
ago
loved
it
for
its
own
sake
he
had
ranged
the
border
a
torch
of
fire
for
years
and
now
he
foresaw
more
of
the
revenge
that
he
craved
incessantly
he
led
without
hesitation
straight
toward
the
north
all
four
were
accomplished
trailers
and
the
flitting
figures
were
soundless
as
they
made
their
swift
march
through
the
forest
in
a
half
hour
they
reached
the
crest
of
a
rather
high
hill
and
black
rifle
stopping
pointed
with
a
long
forefinger
toward
a
low
and
dim
light
the
camp
of
the
pennsylvanians
he
said
with
bitter
irony
as
i
told
you
fearing
lest
the
savages
should
miss
em
in
the
forest
they
keep
their
fire
burning
as
a
beacon
dont
be
too
hard
on
em
black
rifle
said
willet
maybe
they
come
from
philadelphia
itself
and
city
bred
men
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
learn
all
about
the
wilderness
in
a
few
days
theyll
learn
when
its
too
late
at
the
muzzles
of
the
french
and
indian
rifles
rejoined
black
rifle
abating
a
little
his
tone
of
savage
derision
at
least
theyre
likely
to
be
brave
men
said
willet
and
now
what
do
you
think
will
be
our
best
manner
of
approaching
em
well
walk
directly
toward
their
fire
the
four
of
us
abreast
theyll
blaze
away
all
fifty
of
em
together
as
soon
as
they
see
us
but
the
darkness
will
spoil
their
aim
and
at
least
one
of
us
will
be
left
alive
able
to
walk
and
able
to
tell
em
of
their
danger
we
dont
know
wholl
be
the
lucky
man
but
well
see
come
come
captain
jack
give
em
a
chance
they
may
be
a
more
likely
lot
than
you
think
you
three
wait
here
and
ill
go
forward
and
announce
our
coming
i
dare
say
well
be
welcome
willet
advanced
boldly
toward
the
fire
which
he
soon
saw
consisted
of
a
great
bed
of
coals
surrounded
by
sleepers
but
the
figures
of
men
pacing
back
and
forth
showed
that
the
watch
had
not
been
neglected
although
in
the
deep
forest
such
sentinels
would
be
but
little
protection
against
the
kind
of
ambush
the
french
and
indians
were
able
to
lay
not
caring
to
come
within
the
circle
of
light
lest
he
be
fired
upon
the
hunter
whistled
and
when
he
saw
that
the
sentinels
were
at
attention
he
whistled
again
then
he
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
walked
boldly
toward
the
fire
who
are
you
a
voice
demanded
sharply
and
a
young
man
in
a
fine
uniform
stood
up
in
front
of
the
fire
the
hunters
quick
and
penetrating
look
noted
that
he
was
tall
built
well
and
that
his
face
was
frank
and
open
my
name
is
david
willet
he
replied
and
i
am
sometimes
called
by
my
friends
the
iroquois
the
great
bear
behind
me
in
the
woods
are
three
comrades
young
robert
lennox
of
new
york
and
albany
tayoga
a
young
warrior
of
the
clan
of
the
bear
of
the
nation
onondaga
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
the
famous
hunter
and
border
fighter
of
whom
everybody
has
heard
captain
jack
black
hunter
or
black
rifle
as
he
has
been
called
variously
i
know
the
name
replied
the
young
man
and
yours
too
mr
willet
my
own
is
colden
james
colden
of
philadelphia
and
i
am
in
command
of
this
troop
sent
to
guard
the
farthest
settlements
against
the
french
and
indians
will
you
call
your
comrades
mr
willet
all
of
you
are
welcome
the
hunter
whistled
again
and
robert
tayoga
and
black
rifle
advancing
from
the
forest
came
within
the
area
of
half
light
cast
by
the
glow
from
the
coals
young
captain
colden
watching
them
with
the
most
intense
curiosity
as
they
approached
and
well
he
might
feel
surprise
all
even
robert
wore
the
dress
of
the
wilderness
and
their
appearance
at
such
a
time
was
uncommon
and
striking
most
of
the
soldiers
had
been
awakened
by
the
voices
and
were
sitting
up
rubbing
sleepy
eyes
robert
saw
at
once
that
they
were
city
men
singularly
out
of
place
in
the
vast
forest
and
the
darkness
we
welcome
you
to
our
camp
said
young
captain
colden
with
dignity
if
you
are
hungry
we
have
food
and
if
you
are
without
blankets
we
can
furnish
them
to
you
willet
and
tayoga
looked
at
robert
and
he
knew
they
expected
him
to
fill
his
usual
role
of
spokesman
the
words
rushed
to
his
lips
but
they
were
held
there
by
embarrassment
the
soldiers
who
had
been
awakened
were
already
going
back
to
sleep
captain
colden
sat
down
on
a
log
and
waited
for
them
to
state
their
wants
then
robert
spoke
knowing
they
could
not
afford
to
delay
we
thank
you
captain
colden
he
said
for
the
offer
of
supper
and
bed
but
i
must
say
to
you
sir
that
its
no
time
for
either
i
dont
take
your
meaning
mr
lennox
tayoga
mr
willet
and
black
rifle
are
the
best
scouts
in
the
wilderness
and
before
sunset
they
saw
smoke
on
the
horizon
then
they
saw
smoke
answering
smoke
and
black
rifle
has
seen
more
the
french
and
indians
sir
are
in
the
forest
and
theyre
led
too
by
frenchmen
young
james
colden
was
a
brave
man
and
his
eyes
glittered
we
ask
nothing
better
than
to
meet
em
he
said
at
the
first
breath
of
dawn
well
march
against
em
if
your
friends
will
only
be
so
good
as
to
show
us
the
way
its
not
a
matter
of
waiting
until
dawn
nor
even
of
going
to
meet
em
theyll
bring
the
battle
to
us
you
and
your
force
captain
colden
are
surrounded
already
the
young
captain
stared
at
robert
but
his
eyes
were
full
of
incredulity
several
of
the
soldiers
were
standing
near
and
they
too
heard
but
the
warning
found
no
answer
in
their
minds
robert
looked
around
at
the
men
asleep
and
the
others
ready
to
follow
them
and
despite
his
instinctive
liking
for
colden
his
anger
began
to
rise
i
said
that
you
were
surrounded
he
repeated
sharply
and
its
no
time
captain
colden
for
unbelief
mr
willet
tayoga
and
i
saw
the
signals
of
the
enemy
but
black
rifle
here
has
looked
upon
the
warriors
themselves
theyre
led
too
by
the
french
and
the
best
of
all
the
french
forest
captains
st
luc
is
undoubtedly
with
them
off
there
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
north
and
a
little
of
the
high
color
left
coldens
face
the
youths
manner
was
so
earnest
and
his
words
were
spoken
with
so
much
power
of
conviction
that
they
could
not
fail
to
impress
you
really
mean
that
the
french
and
indians
are
here
that
theyre
planning
to
attack
us
tonight
said
the
philadelphian
beyond
a
doubt
and
we
must
be
prepared
to
meet
them
colden
took
a
few
steps
back
and
forth
and
then
like
the
brave
young
man
he
was
he
swallowed
his
pride
i
confess
that
i
dont
know
much
of
the
forest
nor
do
my
men
he
said
and
so
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
four
to
help
me
well
do
it
gladly
said
robert
what
do
you
propose
dave
i
think
wed
better
draw
off
some
distance
from
the
fire
replied
the
hunter
to
the
right
there
is
a
low
hill
covered
with
thick
brush
and
old
logs
thrown
down
by
an
ancient
storm
its
the
very
place
then
said
captain
colden
briskly
well
occupy
it
inside
of
five
minutes
up
men
up
the
sleepers
were
awakened
rapidly
and
although
they
were
awkward
and
made
much
more
noise
than
was
necessary
they
obeyed
their
captains
sharp
order
and
marched
away
with
all
their
arms
and
stores
to
the
thicket
on
the
hill
where
as
willet
had
predicted
they
found
also
a
network
of
fallen
trees
affording
a
fine
shelter
and
defense
here
they
crouched
and
willet
enjoined
upon
them
the
necessity
of
silence
sir
said
young
captain
colden
again
putting
down
his
pride
i
beg
to
thank
you
and
your
comrades
you
dont
owe
us
any
thanks
its
just
what
we
ought
to
have
done
said
willet
lightly
the
wilderness
often
turns
a
false
face
to
those
who
are
not
used
to
it
and
if
we
hadnt
warned
you
wed
have
deserved
shooting
the
faint
whine
of
a
wolf
came
from
a
point
far
in
the
north
its
one
of
their
signals
said
willet
theyll
attack
inside
of
an
hour
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
and
waited
every
heart
beating
hard
chapter
ii
the
ambush
robert
now
had
much
experience
of
indian
attack
and
forest
warfare
but
it
always
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
his
vivid
and
uncommon
imagination
the
great
pulses
in
his
throat
and
temples
leaped
and
his
ear
became
so
keen
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
hear
the
fall
of
the
leaf
in
the
forest
it
was
this
acute
sharpening
of
the
senses
the
painting
of
pictures
before
him
that
gave
him
the
gift
of
golden
speech
that
the
indians
had
first
noticed
in
him
he
saw
and
heard
much
that
others
could
neither
hear
nor
see
and
the
words
to
describe
it
were
always
ready
to
pour
forth
willet
and
tayoga
were
crouched
near
him
their
rifles
thrust
forward
a
little
and
just
beyond
them
was
captain
colden
who
had
drawn
a
small
sword
more
as
an
evidence
of
command
than
as
a
weapon
the
men
city
bred
were
silent
but
the
faces
of
some
of
them
still
expressed
amazement
and
incredulity
roberts
quick
and
powerful
imagination
instantly
projected
itself
into
their
minds
and
he
saw
as
they
saw
to
them
the
cry
of
a
wolf
was
the
cry
of
a
real
wolf
the
forest
was
dark
lonely
and
uncomfortable
but
it
was
empty
of
any
foe
and
the
four
who
had
come
to
them
were
merely
trying
to
create
a
sense
of
their
own
importance
they
began
to
move
restlessly
and
it
required
captain
coldens
whispered
but
sharp
command
to
still
them
again
the
cry
of
the
wolf
used
much
by
both
the
indians
and
the
borderers
as
a
signal
came
now
from
the
east
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
minute
it
was
repeated
from
the
west
call
and
answer
were
a
relief
to
robert
whose
faculties
were
attuned
to
such
a
high
degree
that
any
relief
to
the
strain
though
it
brought
the
certainty
of
attack
was
welcome
youre
sure
those
cries
were
made
by
our
enemies
said
young
colden
beyond
a
doubt
replied
willet
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
note
and
that
of
a
genuine
wolf
but
then
ive
spent
many
years
in
the
wilderness
and
i
had
to
learn
these
things
in
order
to
live
theyll
send
forward
scouts
and
theyll
expect
to
find
you
and
your
men
around
the
fire
most
of
you
asleep
when
they
miss
you
there
theyll
try
to
locate
you
and
theyll
soon
trail
us
to
these
bushes
captain
james
colden
had
his
share
of
pride
and
much
faith
in
himself
but
he
had
nobility
of
soul
too
i
believe
you
implicitly
mr
willet
he
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
and
your
friends
the
enemy
would
have
been
upon
us
when
we
expected
him
not
at
all
and
tis
most
likely
that
all
of
us
would
have
been
killed
and
scalped
so
i
thank
you
now
lest
i
fall
in
the
battle
and
it
be
too
late
then
to
express
my
gratitude
it
was
a
little
bit
formal
and
a
little
bit
youthful
but
willet
accepted
the
words
in
the
fine
spirit
in
which
they
were
uttered
what
we
did
was
no
more
than
we
should
have
done
he
replied
and
youll
pay
us
back
in
such
times
as
these
everybody
ought
to
help
everybody
else
caution
your
soldiers
captain
wont
you
not
to
make
any
noise
at
all
the
wolf
will
howl
no
more
and
i
fancy
their
scouts
are
now
within
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
the
fire
im
glad
its
turned
darker
the
troop
hidden
in
the
bushes
was
now
completely
silent
the
philadelphia
men
used
to
contiguous
houses
and
streets
were
not
afraid
but
they
were
appalled
by
their
extraordinary
position
at
night
in
the
deep
brush
of
an
unknown
wilderness
with
a
creeping
foe
coming
down
upon
them
many
a
hand
quivered
upon
the
rifle
barrel
but
the
heart
of
its
owner
did
not
tremble
the
moonlight
was
scant
and
the
stars
were
few
to
the
city
men
trees
and
bushes
melted
together
in
a
general
blackness
relieved
only
by
a
single
point
of
light
where
the
fire
yet
smoldered
but
robert
kneeling
by
the
side
of
tayoga
saw
with
his
trained
eyes
the
separate
trunks
stretching
away
like
columns
and
then
far
beyond
the
fire
he
thought
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
red
feather
raised
for
a
moment
above
the
undergrowth
did
you
see
he
whispered
to
tayoga
yes
it
was
a
painted
feather
in
the
scalp
lock
of
a
huron
replied
the
onondaga
and
where
he
is
others
are
sure
to
be
well
spoken
dagaeoga
they
have
discovered
already
that
the
soldiers
are
not
by
the
fire
and
now
they
will
search
for
them
they
will
lie
almost
flat
on
their
faces
and
follow
a
little
the
broad
trail
the
city
men
have
left
doubtless
dagaeoga
willet
had
already
warned
captain
colden
and
the
soldiers
were
ready
tayoga
was
on
roberts
right
and
on
his
left
was
black
rifle
to
whom
his
attention
was
now
attracted
the
mans
eyes
were
blazing
in
his
dark
face
and
his
crouched
figure
was
tense
like
that
of
a
lion
about
to
spring
face
and
attitude
alike
expressed
the
most
eager
anticipation
and
robert
shuddered
the
ranger
would
add
more
lives
to
the
toll
of
his
revenge
and
yet
the
youth
felt
sympathy
for
him
too
then
his
mind
became
wholly
absorbed
in
the
battle
which
obviously
was
so
close
at
hand
their
position
was
strong
just
behind
them
the
thickets
ended
in
a
cliff
hard
to
climb
and
on
the
right
was
an
open
space
that
the
enemy
could
not
cross
without
being
seen
hence
the
chief
danger
was
in
front
and
on
the
left
and
most
of
the
men
watched
those
points
i
can
see
the
bushes
moving
about
a
hundred
yards
away
whispered
tayoga
a
warrior
is
there
but
to
fire
at
him
would
be
shooting
at
random
let
them
begin
it
theyll
open
soon
theyll
know
by
our
absence
from
the
fire
that
were
looking
for
em
spoken
well
dagaeoga
youll
be
a
warrior
some
day
robert
smiled
in
the
dark
tayoga
himself
was
so
great
a
warrior
that
he
could
preserve
his
sense
of
humor
upon
the
eve
of
a
deadly
battle
robert
also
saw
bushes
moving
now
but
nothing
was
definite
enough
for
a
shot
and
he
waited
with
his
fingers
on
the
trigger
the
enemy
is
at
hand
captain
colden
said
willet
if
you
will
look
very
closely
at
the
thicket
about
one
hundred
yards
directly
in
front
of
us
youll
see
the
leaves
shaking
yes
i
can
make
out
some
movement
there
said
colden
theyve
discovered
of
course
that
weve
left
the
fire
and
they
know
also
where
we
are
do
you
think
theyll
try
to
rush
us
not
at
all
its
not
the
indian
way
nor
is
it
the
way
either
of
the
french
who
go
with
them
they
know
your
men
are
rawpardon
meinexperienced
troops
and
theyll
put
a
cruel
burden
upon
your
patience
they
may
wait
for
hours
and
theyll
try
in
every
manner
to
wear
them
out
and
to
provoke
them
at
last
into
some
rash
movement
youll
have
to
guard
most
captain
colden
against
the
temper
of
your
troop
if
youll
take
advice
from
one
whos
a
veteran
in
the
woods
youd
better
threaten
them
with
death
for
disobedience
of
orders
as
i
said
before
im
grateful
to
you
for
any
advice
or
suggestion
mr
willet
this
seems
a
long
way
from
philadelphia
and
ill
confess
im
not
so
very
much
at
home
here
he
crawled
among
his
men
and
willet
and
robert
heard
him
threatening
them
in
fierce
whispers
and
their
replies
that
they
would
be
cautious
and
patient
it
was
well
that
willet
had
given
the
advice
as
a
full
hour
passed
without
any
sign
from
the
foe
troops
even
more
experienced
than
the
city
men
might
well
have
concluded
it
was
a
false
alarm
and
that
the
forest
contained
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
bear
there
was
no
sound
and
captain
colden
himself
asked
if
the
warriors
had
not
gone
away
not
a
chance
of
it
replied
willet
they
think
theyre
certain
of
a
victory
and
they
would
not
dream
of
retiring
and
we
have
more
long
waiting
in
the
dark
to
do
i
warned
you
there
is
no
other
way
to
fight
such
enemies
we
must
never
make
the
mistake
of
undervaluing
them
captain
colden
sighed
he
had
a
gallant
heart
and
he
and
his
troop
had
made
a
fine
parade
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
before
he
started
for
the
frontier
but
he
had
expected
to
meet
the
french
in
the
open
perhaps
with
a
bugle
playing
and
he
would
charge
at
the
head
of
his
men
waving
the
neat
small
sword
now
buckled
to
his
side
instead
he
lay
in
a
black
thicket
awaiting
the
attack
of
creeping
savages
nevertheless
he
put
down
his
pride
for
the
third
time
and
resolved
to
trust
the
four
who
had
come
so
opportunely
to
his
aid
and
who
seemed
to
be
so
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
wilderness
another
hour
dragged
its
weary
length
away
and
there
was
no
sound
of
anything
stirring
in
the
forest
the
skies
lightened
a
little
as
the
moon
came
out
casting
a
faint
whitish
tint
over
trees
and
bushes
but
the
brave
young
captain
was
yet
unable
to
see
any
trace
of
the
enemy
do
you
feel
quite
sure
that
were
still
besieged
he
whispered
to
willet
yes
captain
replied
the
hunter
and
as
i
said
patience
is
the
commodity
we
need
most
it
would
be
fatal
for
us
to
force
the
action
but
i
dont
think
we
have
much
longer
to
wait
since
they
cant
induce
us
to
take
some
rash
step
theyre
likely
to
make
a
movement
soon
i
see
the
bushes
waving
again
said
tayoga
it
is
proof
that
the
warriors
are
approaching
it
would
be
well
for
the
soldiers
to
lie
flat
for
a
little
while
captain
colden
adhering
to
his
resolution
to
take
the
advice
of
his
new
friends
crept
along
the
line
telling
the
men
in
sharp
whispers
to
hug
the
earth
a
command
that
they
obeyed
willingly
as
the
darkness
the
silence
and
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
danger
had
begun
to
weigh
heavily
upon
their
nerves
robert
saw
a
bead
of
flame
among
the
bushes
and
heard
a
sharp
report
a
bullet
cut
a
bough
over
his
head
and
a
leaf
drifted
down
upon
his
face
the
soldiers
shifted
uneasily
and
began
to
thrust
their
rifles
forward
but
again
the
stern
command
of
the
young
captain
prompted
by
the
hunter
held
them
down
twas
intended
merely
to
draw
us
said
willet
theyre
sure
were
in
this
wood
but
of
course
they
dont
know
the
exact
location
of
our
men
theyre
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
the
bright
uniforms
but
if
the
men
keep
very
low
they
wont
get
it
it
was
a
tremendous
trial
for
young
and
raw
troops
but
they
managed
to
still
their
nerves
and
to
remain
crouched
and
motionless
a
second
shot
was
fired
soon
and
then
a
third
but
like
the
first
they
were
trial
bullets
and
both
went
high
black
rifle
grew
impatient
the
memory
of
his
murdered
family
began
to
press
upon
him
once
more
the
night
was
black
but
now
it
looked
red
to
him
lying
almost
flat
he
slowly
pulled
himself
forward
like
a
great
wild
beast
stalking
its
prey
colden
looked
at
him
and
then
at
willet
who
nodded
dont
try
to
stop
him
whispered
the
hunter
because
hell
go
anyhow
besides
its
time
for
us
to
reply
to
their
shots
the
dark
form
moving
forward
without
noise
had
a
singular
fascination
for
robert
his
imagination
which
colored
and
magnified
everything
made
black
rifle
sinister
and
supernatural
the
complete
absence
of
sound
as
he
advanced
heightened
the
effect
not
a
leaf
nor
a
blade
of
grass
rustled
presently
he
stopped
and
robert
saw
the
black
muzzle
of
his
rifle
shoot
forward
a
stream
of
flame
leaped
forth
and
then
the
man
quickly
slid
into
a
new
position
a
fierce
shout
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
a
half
dozen
shots
were
fired
bullets
again
cut
twigs
and
leaves
over
roberts
head
but
all
of
them
went
too
high
do
you
think
black
rifle
hit
his
mark
whispered
robert
to
tayoga
it
is
likely
replied
the
onondaga
but
we
may
never
know
i
think
it
would
be
well
dagaeoga
for
you
and
me
to
go
toward
the
left
they
may
try
to
creep
around
our
flank
and
we
must
meet
them
there
willet
and
colden
approved
of
the
plan
and
a
half
dozen
of
the
best
soldiers
went
with
them
the
movement
proving
to
be
wise
as
within
five
minutes
a
scattering
fire
was
opened
upon
that
point
the
soldiers
fired
two
rash
shots
merely
aiming
at
the
reports
and
the
general
blackness
but
robert
and
tayoga
quickly
reduced
them
to
control
insisting
that
they
wait
until
they
saw
a
foe
before
pulling
trigger
again
then
they
sank
back
among
the
bushes
and
remained
quite
still
tayoga
suddenly
drew
a
deep
and
very
long
breath
which
with
him
was
equivalent
to
an
exclamation
what
is
it
tayoga
asked
robert
i
saw
a
bit
of
a
uniform
and
i
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
an
officer
then
we
were
right
in
our
surmise
that
the
french
are
here
leading
the
warriors
it
was
but
a
glimpse
but
it
showed
the
curve
of
his
jaw
and
chin
and
i
knew
him
he
is
one
who
is
beginning
to
be
important
in
your
life
dagaeoga
st
luc
none
other
i
could
not
be
mistaken
he
is
leading
the
attack
upon
us
perhaps
tandakora
is
with
him
the
frenchman
does
not
like
the
ojibway
but
war
makes
strange
comrades
that
was
close
a
bullet
whistled
directly
between
them
and
tayoga
kneeling
fired
in
return
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
aim
as
a
warrior
uttered
the
death
cry
and
a
fierce
shout
of
rage
from
a
dozen
throats
followed
robert
imaginative
ready
to
flame
up
in
a
moment
exulted
not
because
a
warrior
had
fallen
but
because
the
flank
attack
upon
his
own
people
had
been
stopped
in
the
beginning
st
luc
himself
would
have
admitted
that
the
americans
or
the
english
as
he
would
have
called
them
were
acting
wisely
the
soldiers
stirred
by
the
successful
shot
showed
again
a
great
desire
to
fire
at
the
black
woods
but
robert
and
the
onondaga
still
kept
them
down
a
crackling
fire
arose
behind
them
showing
that
the
main
force
had
engaged
and
now
and
then
the
warriors
uttered
defiant
cries
but
robert
had
enough
power
of
will
to
watch
in
front
sure
that
willet
and
black
rifle
were
sufficient
to
guide
the
central
defense
he
observed
intently
the
segment
of
the
circle
in
front
of
them
and
he
wondered
if
st
luc
would
appear
there
again
but
he
concluded
that
he
would
not
since
the
failure
of
the
attempted
surprise
at
that
point
would
be
likely
to
send
him
back
to
the
main
force
do
you
think
theyll
go
away
and
concentrate
in
front
he
asked
tayoga
no
replied
the
onondaga
they
still
think
perhaps
that
they
have
only
the
soldiers
from
the
city
to
meet
and
they
may
attempt
a
rush
robert
crept
from
soldier
to
soldier
cautioning
every
one
to
take
shelter
and
to
have
his
rifle
ready
and
they
being
good
men
though
without
experience
obeyed
the
one
who
so
obviously
knew
what
he
was
doing
meantime
the
combat
behind
them
proceeded
with
vigor
the
shots
crashing
in
volleys
accompanied
by
shouts
and
once
by
the
cry
of
a
stricken
soldier
it
was
evident
that
st
luc
was
now
pushing
the
battle
and
robert
was
quite
sure
the
attack
on
the
flank
would
soon
come
again
they
did
not
wait
much
longer
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
from
the
undergrowth
and
rushed
straight
toward
them
a
white
man
now
in
front
the
light
was
sufficient
for
robert
to
see
that
the
leader
was
not
st
luc
and
then
without
hesitation
he
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
the
man
fell
tayoga
stopped
the
rush
of
a
warrior
and
the
bullets
of
the
soldiers
wounded
others
but
their
white
leader
was
gone
and
indians
have
little
love
for
an
attack
upon
a
sheltered
enemy
so
the
charge
broke
before
it
was
half
way
to
the
defenders
and
the
savages
vanished
in
the
thickets
the
soldiers
began
to
exult
but
robert
bade
them
reload
as
fast
as
possible
and
keep
well
under
cover
the
warriors
from
new
points
would
fire
at
every
exposed
head
and
they
could
not
afford
to
relax
their
caution
for
an
instant
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
for
the
youthful
veterans
of
the
forest
to
keep
the
older
but
inexperienced
men
from
the
city
under
cover
they
had
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
see
the
indians
who
were
shooting
at
them
and
against
whom
they
were
sending
their
bullets
in
spite
of
every
command
and
entreaty
a
man
would
raise
his
head
now
and
then
and
one
as
he
did
so
received
a
bullet
between
the
eyes
falling
back
quietly
dead
before
he
touched
the
ground
a
brave
lad
has
been
lost
whispered
tayoga
to
robert
but
he
has
been
an
involuntary
example
to
the
rest
the
onondaga
spoke
in
his
precise
school
english
but
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
as
the
soldiers
now
became
much
more
cautious
and
controlled
their
impulse
to
raise
up
for
a
look
after
every
shot
another
man
was
wounded
but
the
hurt
was
not
serious
and
he
went
on
with
his
firing
robert
seeing
that
the
line
on
the
flank
could
be
held
without
great
difficulty
left
tayoga
in
command
and
crept
back
to
the
main
force
where
the
bullets
were
coming
much
faster
two
of
the
soldiers
in
the
center
had
been
slain
and
three
had
been
wounded
but
captain
colden
had
not
given
ground
he
was
sitting
behind
a
rocky
outcrop
and
at
the
suggestion
of
willet
was
giving
orders
to
his
men
oppressed
at
first
by
the
ambush
and
weight
of
responsibility
he
was
exulting
now
in
their
ability
to
check
the
savage
onset
robert
was
quite
willing
to
play
a
little
to
his
pride
and
he
said
in
the
formal
military
manner
i
wish
to
report
sir
that
all
is
going
well
on
the
southern
flank
one
of
our
men
has
been
killed
but
we
have
made
it
impossible
for
the
enemy
to
advance
there
thank
you
mr
lennox
said
the
young
captain
with
dignity
we
have
also
had
some
success
here
due
chiefly
to
the
good
advice
of
mr
willet
and
the
prowess
and
sharpshooting
of
the
extraordinary
man
whom
you
call
black
rifle
see
him
now
he
indicated
a
dark
figure
a
little
distance
ahead
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
and
as
robert
looked
a
jet
of
fire
leaped
from
the
muzzle
of
the
mans
rifle
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
cry
in
the
forest
i
think
he
has
slain
more
of
our
enemies
than
the
rest
of
us
combined
said
captain
colden
robert
shuddered
a
little
but
those
who
lived
on
the
border
became
used
to
strange
things
the
constant
struggle
for
existence
hardened
the
nerves
and
terrible
scenes
did
not
dwell
long
in
the
mind
he
bent
forward
for
a
better
look
and
a
bullet
cut
the
hair
upon
his
forehead
he
started
back
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
seared
by
lightning
and
willet
looked
at
him
anxiously
the
lead
burned
as
it
passed
the
lad
said
but
the
skin
is
not
broken
i
was
guilty
of
the
same
rashness
for
which
i
have
been
lecturing
the
men
on
the
flank
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
who
fired
the
shot
said
willet
i
think
it
was
the
canadian
dubois
whom
we
saw
with
st
luc
tayoga
saw
st
luc
himself
on
the
flank
said
robert
and
so
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
leading
the
attack
the
fact
makes
it
certain
that
it
will
be
carried
on
with
persistence
we
shall
be
here
still
besieged
when
day
comes
said
the
hunter
its
lucky
that
the
cliff
protects
us
on
one
side
as
if
to
disprove
his
assertion
all
the
firing
stopped
suddenly
and
for
a
long
time
the
forest
was
silent
fortunately
they
had
water
in
their
canteens
and
they
were
able
to
soothe
the
thirst
of
the
wounded
men
they
talked
also
of
victory
and
knowing
that
it
was
only
two
or
three
hours
until
dawn
captain
coldens
spirits
rose
to
great
heights
he
was
sure
now
that
the
warriors
defeated
had
gone
away
this
frenchman
st
luc
of
whom
they
talked
might
be
a
great
partisan
leader
but
he
would
know
when
the
price
he
was
paying
became
too
high
and
would
draw
off
the
men
believed
their
captain
and
despite
the
earnest
protest
of
the
foresters
began
to
stir
in
the
bushes
shortly
before
dawn
a
rifle
shot
came
from
the
opposing
thickets
and
one
of
them
would
stir
no
more
captain
colden
appalled
was
all
remorse
he
took
the
death
of
the
man
directly
to
himself
and
told
willet
with
emotion
that
all
advice
of
his
would
now
be
taken
at
once
let
the
men
lie
as
close
as
they
can
said
the
hunter
the
day
will
soon
be
here
robert
found
shelter
behind
the
trunk
of
a
huge
oak
and
crouched
there
his
nerves
relaxing
he
did
not
believe
any
further
movement
of
the
enemy
would
come
now
as
the
great
tension
passed
for
a
time
he
was
conscious
of
an
immense
weariness
the
strain
upon
all
the
physical
senses
and
upon
the
mind
as
well
made
him
weak
it
was
a
luxury
merely
to
sit
there
with
his
back
against
the
bark
and
rest
near
him
he
heard
the
soldiers
moving
softly
and
now
and
then
a
wounded
man
asking
for
water
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
it
had
upon
his
face
the
freshness
of
the
dawn
he
wondered
what
the
day
would
bring
the
light
that
came
with
it
would
be
cheerful
and
uplifting
but
it
would
disclose
their
covert
at
least
in
part
and
st
luc
might
lead
both
french
and
indians
in
one
great
rush
better
eat
a
little
said
tayoga
who
had
returned
to
the
center
remember
that
we
have
plenty
of
food
in
our
knapsacks
nor
are
our
canteens
empty
i
had
forgotten
it
said
robert
and
he
ate
and
drank
sparingly
the
breeze
continued
to
freshen
and
in
the
east
the
dawn
broke
gray
turning
to
silver
and
then
to
red
and
gold
the
forest
soon
stood
out
an
infinite
tracery
in
the
dazzling
light
and
then
a
white
fleck
appeared
against
the
wall
of
green
a
flag
of
truce
exclaimed
captain
colden
what
can
they
want
to
say
to
us
let
the
bearer
of
the
flag
appear
first
suggested
willet
and
then
well
talk
with
em
the
figure
of
a
man
holding
up
a
white
handkerchief
appeared
and
it
was
st
luc
himself
as
neat
and
irreproachable
as
if
he
were
attending
a
ball
in
the
intendants
palace
at
quebec
robert
knew
that
he
must
have
been
active
in
the
battle
all
through
the
night
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
it
he
wore
a
fine
closefitting
uniform
of
dark
blue
and
the
handkerchief
of
lace
was
held
aloft
on
the
point
of
a
small
sword
the
golden
hilt
of
which
glittered
in
the
morning
sunlight
he
was
a
strange
figure
in
the
forest
but
a
most
gallant
one
and
to
roberts
eyes
a
chevalier
without
fear
and
without
reproach
i
know
that
you
speak
good
french
mr
lennox
said
captain
colden
will
you
go
forward
and
meet
the
frenchman
you
will
perhaps
know
what
to
say
to
him
and
if
not
you
can
refer
to
mr
willet
and
myself
i
will
do
my
best
sir
said
robert
glad
of
the
chance
to
meet
st
luc
face
to
face
again
he
did
not
know
why
his
heart
leaped
so
every
time
he
saw
the
chevalier
but
his
friendship
for
him
was
undeniable
it
seemed
too
that
st
luc
liked
him
and
robert
felt
sure
that
whatever
hostility
his
official
enemy
felt
for
the
english
cause
there
was
none
for
him
personally
unconsciously
he
began
to
arrange
his
own
attire
of
forest
green
beautifully
dyed
and
decorated
deerskin
that
he
might
not
look
less
neat
than
the
man
whom
he
was
going
to
meet
st
luc
was
standing
under
the
wide
boughs
of
an
oak
his
gold
hilted
rapier
returned
to
its
sheath
and
his
white
lace
handkerchief
to
its
pocket
the
smile
of
welcome
upon
his
face
as
he
saw
the
herald
was
genuine
i
salute
you
mr
lennox
he
said
and
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
i
learned
that
you
were
in
the
force
besieged
by
us
and
its
a
pleasure
to
see
that
youve
escaped
unhurt
when
last
we
met
the
honors
were
yours
you
fairly
defeated
me
at
the
word
play
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
but
you
will
admit
that
the
savage
tandakora
played
into
your
hands
most
opportunely
you
will
admit
also
that
word
play
is
not
sword
play
and
that
in
the
appeal
to
the
sword
we
have
the
advantage
of
you
it
may
seem
so
to
one
who
sees
with
your
eyes
and
from
your
position
said
robert
but
being
myself
im
compelled
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
and
from
our
side
i
wish
to
say
first
however
chevalier
de
st
luc
that
since
you
have
wished
me
a
very
good
morning
i
even
wish
you
a
better
st
luc
laughed
gayly
you
and
i
will
never
be
enemies
it
would
be
against
nature
he
said
no
well
never
be
enemies
but
why
is
it
against
nature
perhaps
i
was
not
happy
in
my
phrase
we
like
each
other
too
well
andin
a
wayour
temperaments
resemble
too
much
to
engender
a
mutual
hate
but
well
to
business
mines
a
mission
of
mercy
i
come
to
receive
the
surrender
of
your
friends
and
yourself
since
continued
resistance
to
us
will
be
vain
robert
smiled
his
gift
of
golden
speech
was
again
making
its
presence
felt
he
had
matched
himself
against
st
luc
before
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
and
they
had
spoken
where
all
might
hear
now
they
two
alone
could
hear
but
he
felt
that
the
test
was
the
same
in
kind
he
knew
that
his
friends
in
the
thickets
behind
him
were
watching
and
he
was
equally
sure
that
french
and
savages
in
the
thickets
before
him
were
watching
too
he
had
no
doubt
the
baleful
eyes
of
tandakora
were
glaring
at
him
at
that
very
moment
and
that
the
fingers
of
the
ojibway
were
eager
to
grasp
his
scalp
the
idea
singularly
enough
caused
him
amusement
because
his
imagination
vivid
as
usual
leaped
far
ahead
and
he
foresaw
that
his
hair
would
never
become
a
trophy
for
tandakora
you
smile
mr
lennox
said
st
luc
do
you
find
my
words
so
amusing
not
amusing
chevalier
oh
no
and
if
in
truth
i
found
them
so
i
would
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
smile
but
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
your
official
enemy
has
underrated
the
strength
of
your
position
that
is
why
my
eyes
expressed
contenti
would
scarcely
call
it
a
smile
i
see
once
more
that
youre
a
master
of
words
mr
lennox
you
play
with
them
as
the
wind
sports
among
the
leaves
but
i
dont
speak
in
jest
monsieur
de
st
luc
im
not
in
command
here
im
merely
a
spokesman
a
herald
or
a
messenger
in
whichever
way
you
should
choose
to
define
me
captain
james
colden
a
gallant
young
officer
of
philadelphia
is
our
leader
but
in
this
instance
i
dont
feel
the
need
of
consulting
him
i
know
that
your
offer
is
kindly
that
it
comes
from
a
generous
soul
but
however
much
it
may
disappoint
you
i
must
decline
it
our
resistance
in
the
night
has
been
quite
successful
we
have
inflicted
upon
you
much
more
damage
than
you
have
inflicted
upon
us
and
ive
no
doubt
the
day
will
witness
a
battle
continued
in
the
same
proportion
st
luc
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
not
loud
but
gayly
and
with
unction
robert
reddened
but
he
could
not
take
offense
as
he
saw
that
none
was
meant
i
no
longer
wonder
at
my
defeat
by
you
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
said
the
chevalier
since
youre
not
merely
a
master
of
words
youre
a
masterartist
ive
no
doubt
if
i
listen
to
you
youll
persuade
me
its
not
you
but
we
who
are
besieged
and
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
yield
to
you
without
further
ado
perhaps
youre
not
so
very
far
wrong
said
robert
recovering
his
assurance
which
was
nearly
always
great
im
sure
captain
colden
would
receive
your
surrender
and
treat
you
well
the
eyes
of
the
two
met
and
twinkled
tandakora
is
with
us
said
st
luc
and
ive
a
notion
he
wouldnt
relish
it
perhaps
he
distrusts
the
mercy
he
would
receive
at
the
hands
of
your
onondaga
tayoga
and
at
this
point
in
our
dialogue
mr
lennox
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
again
for
the
actions
of
the
ojibway
before
the
war
really
began
i
couldnt
prevent
them
but
since
there
is
genuine
war
he
is
our
ally
and
i
must
accord
to
him
all
the
dignities
and
honors
appertaining
to
his
position
youre
rather
deft
with
words
yourself
monsieur
de
st
luc
once
at
new
york
i
saw
a
juggler
with
balls
who
could
keep
five
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
and
in
some
dim
and
remote
way
you
make
me
think
of
him
youll
pardon
the
illustration
chevalier
because
i
really
mean
it
as
a
compliment
i
pardon
gladly
enough
because
i
see
your
intentions
are
good
we
both
play
with
words
perhaps
because
the
exercise
tickles
our
fancy
but
to
return
to
the
true
spirit
and
essence
of
things
i
warn
you
that
it
would
be
wise
to
surrender
my
force
is
very
much
greater
than
captain
coldens
and
has
him
hemmed
in
if
my
indian
allies
suffer
too
much
in
the
attack
it
will
be
difficult
to
restrain
them
im
not
stating
this
as
a
threatyou
know
me
too
well
for
thatbut
to
make
the
facts
plain
and
to
avoid
something
that
i
should
regret
as
much
as
you
i
dont
think
it
necessary
to
consult
captain
colden
and
without
doing
so
i
decline
your
offer
we
have
food
to
eat
water
to
drink
and
bullets
to
shoot
and
if
you
care
to
take
us
you
must
come
and
do
so
and
that
is
the
final
answer
youre
quite
sure
you
dont
wish
to
consult
your
superior
officer
captain
colden
absolutely
sure
it
would
waste
the
time
of
all
of
us
then
it
seems
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
and
to
use
your
own
fanciful
way
of
putting
it
we
must
go
back
from
the
play
of
words
to
the
play
of
swords
i
see
no
alternative
and
yet
i
hope
that
you
will
survive
the
combat
mr
lennox
ive
the
same
hope
for
you
chevalier
de
st
luc
each
meant
it
and
in
the
same
high
manner
of
the
day
they
saluted
and
withdrew
robert
as
he
walked
back
to
the
thickets
in
which
the
defenders
lay
felt
that
indian
eyes
were
upon
him
and
that
perhaps
an
indian
bullet
would
speed
toward
him
despite
st
luc
tandakora
and
the
savages
around
him
could
not
always
be
controlled
by
their
french
allies
as
was
to
be
shown
too
often
in
this
war
his
sensitive
mind
once
more
turned
fancy
into
reality
and
the
hair
on
his
head
lifted
a
little
but
pride
would
not
let
him
hasten
his
steps
no
gun
was
fired
and
with
an
immense
relief
he
sank
down
behind
a
fallen
log
and
by
the
side
of
colden
and
willet
what
did
the
frenchman
want
asked
the
young
captain
our
instant
and
unconditional
surrender
knowing
how
you
felt
about
it
i
gave
him
your
refusal
at
once
well
done
mr
lennox
he
said
that
in
case
of
a
rush
and
heavy
loss
by
his
indians
he
perhaps
would
not
be
able
to
control
them
in
the
moment
of
victory
which
doubtless
is
true
they
will
know
no
moment
of
victory
we
can
hold
them
off
where
is
tayoga
asked
robert
of
willet
the
hunter
pointed
westward
why
the
cliff
shuts
off
the
way
in
that
direction
said
robert
not
to
a
good
climber
do
you
mean
then
that
tayoga
is
gone
i
saw
him
go
he
went
while
you
were
talking
with
st
luc
why
should
tayoga
leave
us
he
saw
another
smoke
against
the
sky
it
was
but
a
faint
trace
only
an
extremely
keen
eye
would
have
noticed
it
and
having
much
natural
curiosity
tayoga
is
now
on
his
way
to
see
who
built
the
fire
that
made
the
smoke
and
it
may
have
been
made
by
friends
thats
our
hope
robert
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
toward
the
west
the
sky
was
now
clear
there
but
he
knew
that
tayoga
could
not
have
made
any
mistake
then
his
heart
high
once
more
he
settled
himself
down
to
wait
chapter
iii
the
signal
the
day
advanced
brilliant
with
sunshine
and
the
forces
of
st
luc
were
quiet
for
a
long
time
not
a
shot
was
fired
and
it
seemed
to
the
besieged
that
the
forest
was
empty
of
human
beings
save
themselves
robert
did
not
believe
the
french
leader
would
attempt
a
long
siege
since
an
engagement
could
not
be
conducted
in
that
manner
in
the
forest
where
a
result
of
some
kind
must
be
reached
soon
yet
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
plan
st
luc
had
in
mind
and
they
must
wait
until
tayoga
came
young
captain
colden
was
in
good
spirits
it
was
his
first
taste
of
wilderness
warfare
and
he
knew
that
he
had
done
well
the
dead
were
laid
decently
among
the
bushes
to
receive
christian
burial
later
if
the
chance
came
and
the
wounded
their
hurts
bound
up
prepared
to
take
what
part
they
could
in
a
new
battle
robert
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
looked
toward
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
saw
only
a
dazzling
blue
sky
unflecked
by
anything
save
little
white
clouds
and
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
whether
the
mission
of
his
young
onondaga
comrade
would
have
any
success
he
crept
back
to
the
side
of
willet
have
you
any
opinion
dave
about
the
smoke
that
tayoga
saw
he
asked
none
robert
just
a
hope
it
might
have
been
made
by
another
french
and
indian
band
most
probably
it
was
but
there
is
a
chance
too
that
friends
built
the
fire
if
its
a
force
of
any
size
it
could
hardly
be
english
i
dont
think
any
troop
of
ours
except
captain
coldens
is
in
this
region
we
cant
look
for
help
from
our
own
race
robert
was
silent
gazing
intently
into
the
west
whence
tayoga
had
gone
he
recognized
the
immense
difficulties
of
their
position
indians
if
an
attack
or
two
of
theirs
failed
would
be
likely
to
go
away
but
the
french
and
especially
st
luc
would
increase
their
persistence
and
hold
them
to
the
task
he
returned
to
the
forest
and
his
attention
was
drawn
once
more
by
black
rifle
the
man
was
lying
almost
flat
in
the
thicket
and
evidently
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
foe
as
he
was
writhing
slowly
forward
like
a
great
beast
of
prey
and
his
eyes
once
more
had
the
expectant
look
of
one
who
is
going
to
strike
robert
considered
him
he
knew
that
the
mans
whole
nature
had
been
poisoned
by
the
great
tragedy
in
his
life
and
that
it
gave
him
a
sinister
pleasure
to
inflict
blows
upon
those
who
had
inflicted
the
great
blow
upon
him
yet
he
would
be
useful
in
the
fierce
war
that
was
upon
them
and
he
was
useful
now
black
rifle
crept
forward
two
or
three
yards
more
and
after
he
had
lain
quite
still
for
a
few
moments
he
suddenly
thrust
out
his
rifle
and
fired
a
cry
came
from
the
opposing
thicket
and
robert
heard
the
sharpshooter
utter
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
knew
that
st
luc
was
one
warrior
less
which
was
good
for
the
defense
but
he
shuddered
a
little
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
steal
through
the
bushes
and
shoot
an
unseeing
enemy
still
black
rifle
was
black
rifle
and
being
what
he
was
he
was
not
to
be
judged
as
other
men
were
after
a
half
hours
silence
the
besiegers
suddenly
opened
fire
from
five
or
six
points
sending
perhaps
two
score
bullets
into
the
wood
clipping
off
many
twigs
and
leaves
which
fell
upon
the
heads
of
the
defenders
captain
colden
did
not
forget
to
be
grateful
to
willet
for
his
insistence
that
the
soldiers
should
always
lie
low
as
the
hostile
lead
instead
of
striking
now
merely
sent
a
harmless
shower
upon
them
but
the
fusillade
was
brief
robert
in
truth
judging
that
it
had
been
against
the
commands
of
st
luc
who
was
too
wise
a
leader
to
wish
ammunition
to
be
wasted
in
random
firing
at
the
advice
of
willet
captain
colden
would
not
let
his
men
reply
restraining
their
eagerness
and
silence
soon
returned
it
was
nearly
noon
now
and
a
huge
golden
sun
shone
over
the
vast
wilderness
in
which
two
little
bands
of
men
fought
mere
motes
in
the
limitless
sea
of
green
robert
ate
some
venison
and
drank
a
little
water
from
the
canteen
of
a
friendly
soldier
then
his
thoughts
turned
again
to
tayoga
the
onondaga
was
a
peerless
runner
he
had
been
gone
long
now
and
what
would
he
find
at
the
base
of
the
smoke
if
it
had
been
the
fire
of
an
enemy
then
he
would
be
back
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
they
would
be
in
no
worse
case
than
before
they
might
try
to
escape
in
the
night
down
the
cliff
but
it
was
not
likely
that
vigilant
foes
would
permit
men
clumsy
in
the
woods
like
the
soldiers
to
steal
away
in
such
a
manner
the
earlier
hours
of
the
afternoon
were
passed
by
the
sharpshooters
on
either
side
trying
to
stalk
one
another
although
robert
had
no
part
in
it
it
was
a
savage
play
that
alternately
fascinated
and
repelled
him
he
had
no
way
to
tell
exactly
but
he
believed
that
two
more
of
the
indians
had
fallen
while
a
soldier
received
a
wound
a
bullet
grazed
black
rifles
head
but
instead
of
daunting
him
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
kind
of
fierce
joy
and
to
inspire
in
him
a
greater
desire
to
slay
these
efforts
since
they
achieved
no
positive
results
soon
died
down
and
both
sides
lay
silent
in
their
coverts
robert
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
he
could
behind
a
log
although
he
longed
to
stand
upright
and
walk
about
once
more
like
a
human
being
it
was
now
midafternoon
and
if
the
smoke
had
meant
nothing
good
for
them
it
was
time
for
tayoga
to
be
back
it
was
not
conceivable
that
such
a
marvelous
forester
and
matchless
runner
could
have
been
taken
and
since
he
had
not
come
roberts
heart
again
beat
to
the
tune
of
hope
willet
with
whom
he
talked
a
little
was
of
like
opinion
he
looked
to
tayoga
to
bring
them
help
and
if
he
failed
their
case
already
hard
would
become
harder
the
hunter
did
not
conceal
from
himself
the
prowess
and
skill
of
st
luc
and
he
knew
too
that
the
savage
persistency
of
tandakora
was
not
to
be
held
lightly
like
robert
he
gazed
long
into
the
blue
west
which
was
flecked
only
by
little
clouds
of
white
a
sign
a
sign
he
said
if
we
could
only
behold
a
sign
but
the
heavens
said
nothing
the
sun
a
huge
ball
of
glowing
copper
was
already
far
down
the
western
curve
and
the
hunters
heart
beat
hard
with
anxiety
he
felt
that
if
help
came
it
should
come
soon
but
little
water
was
left
to
the
soldiers
although
their
food
might
last
another
day
and
the
night
itself
now
not
far
away
would
bring
the
danger
of
a
new
attack
by
a
creeping
foe
greatly
superior
in
numbers
he
turned
away
from
the
cliff
but
robert
remained
and
presently
the
youth
called
in
a
sharp
thrilling
whisper
dave
dave
come
back
robert
had
continued
to
watch
the
sky
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
faint
dark
line
against
the
sea
of
blue
he
rubbed
his
eyes
fearing
it
was
a
fault
of
vision
but
the
trace
was
still
there
and
he
believed
it
to
be
smoke
dave
dave
the
signal
look
look
he
cried
the
hunter
came
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
stared
into
the
west
a
thread
of
black
lay
across
the
blue
and
his
heart
leaped
do
you
believe
that
tayoga
has
anything
to
do
with
it
asked
robert
i
do
if
it
were
our
foes
out
there
hed
have
been
back
long
since
and
since
it
may
be
friends
theyve
sent
up
this
smoke
hoping
well
divine
what
they
mean
it
looks
like
it
tayoga
is
a
sharp
lad
and
hell
want
to
put
heart
in
the
soldiers
it
must
be
the
onondaga
and
i
wish
i
knew
what
his
smoke
was
saying
captain
colden
joined
them
and
they
pointed
out
to
him
the
trace
across
the
sky
which
was
now
broadening
explaining
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
probably
a
signal
sent
up
by
tayoga
and
that
he
might
be
leading
a
force
to
their
aid
what
help
could
he
bring
asked
the
captain
willet
shook
his
head
i
cant
answer
you
there
he
replied
but
the
smoke
has
significance
for
us
of
that
i
feel
sure
by
sundown
well
know
what
it
means
and
thats
only
about
two
hours
away
said
captain
colden
whatever
happens
well
hold
out
to
the
last
i
suppose
though
that
st
lucs
force
also
will
see
the
smoke
quite
likely
replied
willet
and
the
frenchman
may
send
a
runner
too
to
see
what
it
means
but
however
good
a
runner
he
may
be
hell
be
no
match
for
tayoga
thats
sure
said
robert
so
great
was
his
confidence
in
the
onondaga
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
killed
or
taken
and
he
awaited
his
certain
return
either
with
or
without
a
helping
force
he
lay
now
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
whence
he
could
look
toward
the
west
the
point
of
hope
whenever
he
wished
ate
another
strip
of
venison
and
took
another
drink
of
water
out
of
a
friendly
canteen
the
west
was
now
blazing
with
terraces
of
red
and
yellow
rising
above
one
another
and
the
east
was
misty
gray
and
dim
twilight
was
not
far
away
the
thread
of
smoke
that
had
lain
against
the
sky
above
the
forest
was
gone
the
glittering
bar
of
red
and
gold
being
absolutely
free
from
any
trace
st
lucs
force
opened
fire
again
bullets
clipping
twigs
and
leaves
but
the
defense
lay
quiet
except
black
rifle
who
crept
back
and
forth
continually
seeking
a
target
and
pulling
the
trigger
whenever
he
found
it
the
misty
gray
in
the
east
turned
to
darkness
in
the
west
the
sun
went
down
the
slope
of
the
world
and
the
brilliant
terraces
of
color
began
to
fade
the
firing
ceased
and
another
tense
period
of
quiet
hard
to
endure
came
at
the
suggestion
of
the
hunter
colden
drew
in
his
whole
troop
near
the
cliff
and
waited
all
despite
their
weariness
and
strain
keeping
the
keenest
watch
they
could
but
robert
instead
of
looking
toward
the
east
where
st
lucs
force
was
invariably
looked
into
the
sunset
because
it
was
there
that
tayoga
had
gone
and
it
was
there
that
they
had
seen
the
smoke
of
which
they
expected
so
much
the
terraces
of
color
already
grown
dim
were
now
fading
fast
at
the
top
they
were
gone
altogether
and
they
only
lingered
low
down
but
on
the
forest
the
red
light
yet
blazed
every
twig
and
leaf
seemed
to
stand
individual
and
distinct
black
against
a
scarlet
shield
but
it
was
for
merely
a
few
minutes
then
all
the
red
glow
disappeared
like
a
great
light
going
out
suddenly
and
the
western
forest
as
well
as
the
eastern
lay
in
a
gray
gloom
it
always
seemed
to
robert
that
the
last
going
of
the
sunset
that
day
was
like
a
signal
because
when
the
night
swept
down
black
and
complete
everywhere
there
was
a
burst
of
heavy
firing
from
the
south
and
a
long
exultant
yell
no
bullet
sped
through
the
thickets
where
the
defenders
lay
and
willet
cried
tayoga
tayoga
and
help
ah
here
they
come
the
mohawks
tayoga
panting
from
exertion
sprang
into
the
bushes
among
them
and
he
was
followed
by
a
tall
figure
in
war
paint
lofty
plumes
waving
from
his
war
bonnet
behind
him
came
many
warriors
and
others
were
already
on
the
flanks
spreading
out
like
a
fan
filing
rapidly
and
shouting
the
war
whoop
robert
recognized
at
once
the
great
figure
that
stood
before
them
it
was
daganoweda
the
young
mohawk
chief
of
his
earlier
acquaintance
whom
he
had
met
both
on
the
war
path
and
at
the
great
council
of
the
fifty
sachems
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
had
his
been
the
right
to
choose
the
man
who
was
to
come
to
their
aid
the
mohawk
would
have
been
his
first
choice
robert
knew
his
intense
hatred
of
the
french
and
their
red
allies
and
he
also
knew
his
fierce
courage
and
great
ability
in
battle
the
soldiers
looked
in
some
alarm
at
the
painted
host
that
had
sprung
among
them
but
willet
and
robert
assured
them
insistently
that
these
were
friends
and
the
sound
of
the
battle
they
were
already
waging
on
the
flank
with
st
lucs
force
was
proof
enough
captain
colden
said
robert
not
forgetful
that
an
indian
likes
the
courtesies
of
life
and
can
take
his
compliments
thick
this
is
the
great
young
mohawk
chief
daganoweda
which
in
our
language
means
the
inexhaustible
and
such
he
is
inexhaustible
in
resource
and
courage
in
battle
and
in
loyalty
to
his
friends
daganoweda
smiled
and
extended
his
hand
in
the
white
mans
fashion
young
colden
had
the
tact
to
shake
it
heartily
at
once
and
to
say
in
english
which
the
young
mohawk
chief
understood
perfectly
daganoweda
whatever
praise
of
you
mr
lennox
has
given
its
not
half
enough
i
confess
now
although
i
would
not
have
admitted
it
before
that
if
you
had
not
come
we
should
probably
have
been
lost
he
had
made
a
friend
for
life
and
then
without
further
words
the
two
turned
to
the
battle
but
robert
remained
for
a
minute
beside
tayoga
whose
chest
was
still
heaving
with
his
great
exertions
where
did
you
find
them
he
asked
many
miles
to
the
west
lennox
after
i
descended
the
cliff
i
was
pursued
by
huron
skirmishers
and
i
had
to
shake
them
off
then
i
ran
at
full
speed
toward
the
point
where
the
smoke
had
risen
knowing
that
the
need
was
great
and
i
overtook
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
their
first
smoke
was
but
that
from
a
campfire
as
being
in
strong
force
they
did
not
care
who
saw
them
but
the
last
just
before
the
sunset
was
sent
up
as
a
signal
by
two
warriors
whom
we
left
behind
for
the
purpose
we
thought
you
might
take
it
to
mean
that
help
was
coming
and
so
we
did
how
many
warriors
has
daganoweda
fifty
and
that
is
enough
already
they
push
the
frenchman
and
his
force
before
them
come
we
must
join
them
dagaeoga
the
breath
has
come
back
into
my
body
and
i
am
a
strong
man
again
the
two
now
quickly
took
their
places
in
the
battle
in
the
night
and
the
forest
the
position
of
the
two
forces
being
reversed
the
soldiers
and
the
mohawks
were
pushing
the
combat
at
every
point
and
the
agile
warriors
extending
themselves
on
the
flanks
had
already
driven
in
st
lucs
skirmishers
black
rifle
uttering
fierce
shouts
was
leading
a
strong
attack
in
the
center
the
firing
was
now
rapid
and
much
heavier
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
before
flashes
of
flame
appeared
everywhere
in
the
thicket
above
the
crackle
of
rifles
and
muskets
swelled
the
long
thrilling
war
cry
of
the
mohawks
and
back
in
fierce
defiance
came
the
yells
of
the
hurons
and
abenakis
willet
joined
robert
and
the
two
with
tayoga
saw
that
the
soldiers
fought
well
under
cover
the
young
philadelphians
in
the
excitement
of
battle
and
of
a
sudden
and
triumphant
reversal
of
fortune
were
likely
to
expose
themselves
rashly
and
the
advice
of
the
forest
veterans
was
timely
captain
colden
saw
that
it
was
taken
although
two
more
of
his
men
were
slain
as
they
advanced
and
several
were
wounded
but
the
issue
was
no
longer
doubtful
the
weight
that
the
mohawks
had
suddenly
thrown
into
the
battle
was
too
great
the
force
of
st
luc
was
steadily
driven
northward
and
daganowedas
alert
skirmishers
on
the
flanks
kept
it
compressed
together
robert
knew
how
bitter
the
defeat
would
be
to
st
luc
but
the
knowledge
did
not
keep
his
exultation
from
mounting
to
a
high
pitch
st
luc
might
strive
with
all
his
might
to
keep
his
men
in
the
battle
but
the
frenchmen
could
not
be
numerous
and
it
was
the
custom
of
indians
once
a
combat
seemed
lost
to
melt
away
like
a
mist
they
believed
thoroughly
that
it
was
best
to
run
away
and
fight
another
day
and
there
was
no
disgrace
in
escaping
from
a
stricken
field
they
run
they
run
and
the
frenchmen
must
run
with
them
exclaimed
black
rifle
as
he
spoke
a
bullet
grazed
his
side
and
struck
a
soldier
behind
him
but
the
force
pressed
on
with
the
ardor
fed
by
victory
willet
did
not
try
any
longer
to
restrain
them
although
he
understood
full
well
the
danger
of
a
battle
in
the
dark
but
he
knew
that
daganoweda
and
his
mohawks
experienced
in
every
forest
wile
would
guard
them
against
surprise
and
he
deemed
it
best
now
that
they
should
strike
with
all
their
might
robert
seldom
saw
any
of
the
warriors
before
him
and
he
did
not
once
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
frenchman
whenever
his
rifle
was
loaded
he
fired
at
a
flitting
form
never
knowing
whether
or
not
his
bullet
struck
true
and
glad
of
his
ignorance
his
sensitive
and
imaginative
mind
became
greatly
excited
the
flashes
of
flame
in
the
thickets
were
multiplied
a
hundred
fold
a
thousand
little
pulses
beat
heavily
in
his
temples
and
the
shouts
of
the
savages
seemed
to
fill
the
forest
but
he
pressed
on
conscious
that
the
enemy
was
disappearing
before
them
in
his
eagerness
he
passed
ahead
of
willet
and
tayoga
and
came
very
near
to
st
lucs
retreating
line
his
foot
became
entangled
in
trailing
vines
and
he
fell
but
he
was
up
in
an
instant
and
he
fired
at
a
shadowy
figure
not
more
than
twenty
feet
in
advance
in
his
haste
he
missed
and
the
figure
turning
raised
a
rifle
there
was
a
fair
moonlight
and
robert
saw
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
bearing
directly
upon
him
and
he
knew
too
that
the
rifle
was
held
by
firm
hands
his
vivid
and
sensitive
imagination
at
once
leaped
into
intense
life
his
own
weapon
was
empty
and
his
last
moment
had
come
he
saw
the
strong
brown
hands
holding
the
rifle
and
then
his
gaze
passed
on
to
the
face
of
st
luc
he
saw
the
blue
eyes
of
the
frenchman
as
they
looked
down
the
sights
open
wide
in
a
kind
of
horror
then
he
abruptly
dropped
the
muzzle
waved
one
hand
to
robert
and
vanished
in
the
thickets
and
the
darkness
the
battle
was
over
there
were
a
few
dying
shots
scattered
beads
of
flame
an
occasional
shout
of
triumph
from
the
mohawks
a
defiant
yell
or
two
in
reply
from
the
hurons
and
the
abenakis
and
then
the
trail
of
the
combat
swept
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
robert
who
stood
dazed
and
yet
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
st
luc
had
held
his
life
upon
the
pressure
of
a
trigger
and
the
trigger
would
have
been
pulled
had
he
not
seen
before
it
was
too
late
who
stood
before
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
the
moonlight
was
enough
for
robert
to
see
that
look
of
horror
in
his
eyes
when
he
recognized
the
target
and
then
the
weapon
had
been
turned
away
and
he
had
gone
like
a
flash
why
for
what
reason
had
st
luc
spared
him
in
the
heat
and
fury
of
a
desperate
and
losing
battle
it
must
have
been
a
powerful
motive
for
a
man
to
stay
his
bullet
at
such
a
time
wake
up
lad
wake
up
the
battle
has
been
won
willets
heavy
but
friendly
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
and
robert
came
out
of
his
daze
he
decided
at
once
that
he
would
say
nothing
about
the
meeting
with
st
luc
and
merely
remarked
in
a
cryptic
manner
i
was
stunned
for
a
moment
by
a
bullet
that
did
not
hit
me
yes
weve
won
dave
thanks
to
the
mohawks
thanks
to
daganoweda
and
his
brave
mohawks
and
to
tayoga
and
to
the
gallant
captain
colden
and
his
gallant
men
all
of
us
together
have
made
the
triumph
possible
i
understand
that
the
bodies
of
only
two
frenchmen
have
been
found
and
that
neither
was
that
of
st
luc
well
im
glad
that
frenchman
will
do
us
great
damage
in
this
war
but
hes
an
honorable
foe
and
a
man
of
heart
and
i
like
him
a
man
of
heart
yes
truly
none
knew
it
better
than
robert
but
again
he
kept
his
own
counsel
he
too
was
glad
that
his
had
not
been
one
of
the
two
french
bodies
found
but
there
was
still
danger
from
the
pursuing
mohawks
who
would
hang
on
tenaciously
and
he
felt
a
sudden
thrill
of
alarm
but
it
passed
as
he
remembered
that
the
chevalier
was
a
woodsman
of
experience
and
surpassing
skill
tayoga
came
back
to
them
somewhat
blown
he
had
followed
the
fleeing
french
and
indian
force
two
or
three
miles
but
there
was
a
limit
even
to
his
nerves
and
sinews
of
wrought
steel
he
had
already
run
thirty
miles
before
joining
in
the
combat
and
now
it
was
time
to
rest
come
tayoga
said
the
hunter
well
go
back
to
the
ground
our
lads
have
defended
so
well
and
eat
drink
and
sleep
the
mohawks
will
attend
to
all
the
work
thats
left
which
isnt
much
weve
earned
our
repose
captain
colden
slightly
wounded
in
the
arm
appeared
and
willet
gave
him
the
high
compliments
that
he
and
his
soldiers
deserved
he
told
him
it
was
seldom
that
men
unused
to
the
woods
bore
themselves
so
well
in
an
indian
fight
but
the
young
captain
modestly
disclaimed
the
chief
merit
replying
that
he
and
his
detachment
would
surely
have
been
lost
had
it
not
been
for
willet
and
his
comrades
then
they
went
back
to
the
ground
near
the
cliff
where
they
had
made
their
great
fight
and
willet
although
the
night
was
warm
wisely
had
a
large
fire
built
he
knew
the
psychological
and
stimulating
effect
of
heat
and
light
upon
the
lads
of
the
city
who
had
passed
through
such
a
fearful
ordeal
in
the
dark
and
indianhaunted
forest
he
encouraged
them
to
throw
on
more
dead
boughs
until
the
blaze
leaped
higher
and
higher
and
sparkled
and
roared
sending
up
myriads
of
joyous
sparks
that
glowed
for
their
brief
lives
among
the
trees
and
then
died
no
fear
of
st
luc
and
the
indians
now
that
fierce
fringe
of
mohawks
was
a
barrier
that
they
could
never
pass
even
should
they
choose
to
return
and
no
such
choice
could
possibly
be
theirs
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
in
increasing
volume
and
the
philadelphia
lads
recovering
from
the
collapse
that
had
followed
tremendous
exertions
and
excitement
began
to
appreciate
the
extent
of
their
victory
and
to
talk
eagerly
with
one
another
but
the
period
of
full
rest
had
not
yet
come
captain
colden
made
them
dig
with
their
bayonets
shallow
graves
for
their
dead
six
in
number
fluent
of
speech
his
sensitive
mind
again
fitting
into
the
deep
gravity
of
the
situation
robert
said
a
few
words
above
them
words
that
he
felt
words
that
moved
those
who
heard
then
the
earth
was
thrown
in
and
stones
and
heavy
boughs
were
placed
over
all
to
keep
away
the
digging
wolves
or
other
wild
animals
the
wounded
were
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
before
the
fire
and
in
the
light
of
the
brilliant
flames
the
awe
created
by
the
dead
quickly
passed
food
was
served
and
fresh
water
was
drunk
the
canteens
being
refilled
from
a
spring
that
tayoga
found
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
the
soldiers
save
six
who
had
been
posted
as
guard
stretched
themselves
on
grass
or
leaves
and
fell
asleep
one
by
one
tayoga
who
had
made
the
greatest
physical
effort
followed
them
to
the
land
of
slumber
but
captain
colden
sat
and
talked
with
robert
and
willet
although
it
was
now
far
past
midnight
the
bushes
parted
and
a
dark
figure
making
no
sound
as
it
came
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
it
was
black
rifle
and
his
eyes
still
glittered
but
he
said
nothing
robert
thought
he
saw
upon
his
face
a
look
of
intense
satisfaction
and
once
more
he
shuddered
a
little
the
man
lay
down
with
his
rifle
beside
him
and
fell
asleep
his
hands
still
clutching
his
weapon
before
dawn
daganoweda
and
the
mohawks
came
back
also
and
robert
in
behalf
of
them
all
thanked
the
young
chief
in
the
purest
mohawk
and
with
the
fine
phrasing
and
apt
allegory
so
dear
to
the
indian
heart
daganoweda
made
a
fitting
reply
saying
that
the
merit
did
not
belong
to
him
but
to
manitou
and
then
leaving
a
half
dozen
of
his
warriors
to
join
in
the
watch
he
and
the
others
slept
before
the
fire
it
was
well
that
you
played
so
strongly
upon
the
feelings
of
the
mohawks
at
that
test
in
the
vale
of
onondaga
robert
said
willet
if
you
had
not
said
over
and
over
again
that
the
quebec
of
the
french
was
once
the
stadacona
of
the
mohawks
they
would
not
have
been
here
tonight
to
save
us
they
say
that
deeds
speak
louder
than
words
but
when
the
same
man
speaks
with
both
words
and
deeds
people
have
got
to
hear
you
give
me
too
much
credit
dave
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
mohawk
attack
upon
the
french
aye
lad
but
one
had
to
see
a
chance
and
use
it
now
join
all
those
fellows
in
sleep
we
wont
move
before
noon
but
roberts
brain
was
too
active
for
sleep
just
yet
while
his
imaginative
power
made
him
see
things
before
other
people
saw
them
he
also
continued
to
see
them
after
they
were
gone
the
wilderness
battle
passed
once
more
before
him
and
when
he
brushed
his
eyes
to
thrust
it
away
he
looked
at
the
sleeping
mohawks
and
thought
what
splendid
savages
they
were
the
other
tribes
of
the
hodenosaunee
were
still
holding
to
their
neutralityall
that
was
asked
of
thembut
the
mohawks
with
the
memories
of
their
ancient
wrongs
burning
in
their
hearts
had
openly
taken
the
side
of
the
english
and
tonight
their
valor
and
skill
had
undoubtedly
saved
the
american
force
daganoweda
was
a
hero
and
so
was
tayoga
the
onondaga
always
the
first
of
red
men
to
robert
his
heated
brain
began
to
grow
cool
at
last
the
vivid
pictures
that
had
been
passing
so
fast
before
his
eyes
faded
he
saw
only
reality
the
blazing
fire
the
dusky
figures
lying
motionless
before
it
and
the
circling
wall
of
dark
woods
then
he
slept
willet
was
the
only
white
man
who
remained
awake
he
saw
the
great
fire
die
and
the
dawn
come
in
its
place
he
felt
then
for
the
first
time
in
all
that
long
encounter
the
strangeness
of
his
own
position
the
wilderness
savages
and
forest
battle
had
become
natural
to
him
and
yet
his
life
had
once
been
far
different
there
was
a
taste
of
a
distant
past
in
that
fierce
duel
at
quebec
when
he
slew
the
bravo
boucher
a
deed
for
which
he
had
never
felt
a
moments
regret
and
yet
when
he
balanced
the
old
times
against
the
present
he
could
not
say
which
had
the
advantage
he
had
found
true
friends
in
the
woods
men
who
would
and
did
risk
their
own
lives
to
save
his
the
dawn
came
swiftly
flooding
the
earth
with
light
daganoweda
and
many
of
the
mohawk
warriors
awoke
but
the
young
philadelphia
captain
and
his
men
slept
on
plunged
in
the
utter
stupor
of
exhaustion
tayoga
who
had
made
a
supreme
effort
both
physical
and
mental
also
continued
to
sleep
and
robert
lying
with
his
feet
to
the
coals
never
stirred
daganoweda
shook
himself
and
so
shaking
shook
the
last
shred
of
sleep
from
his
eyes
then
he
looked
with
pride
at
his
warriors
those
who
yet
lay
upon
the
ground
and
those
who
had
arisen
he
was
a
young
chief
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
and
he
was
the
bloom
and
flower
of
mohawk
courage
and
daring
his
name
daganoweda
the
inexhaustible
was
fully
deserved
as
his
bravery
and
resource
were
unlimited
but
unlike
tayoga
he
had
in
him
none
of
the
priestly
quality
he
had
not
drunk
or
even
sipped
at
the
white
mans
civilization
the
spirituality
so
often
to
be
found
in
the
onondagas
was
unknown
to
him
he
was
a
warrior
first
last
and
all
the
time
he
was
daganoweda
of
the
clan
of
the
turtle
of
the
nation
ganeagaono
the
keepers
of
the
eastern
gate
of
the
great
league
of
the
hodenosaunee
and
he
craved
no
glory
save
that
to
be
won
in
battle
which
he
craved
all
the
time
daganoweda
as
he
looked
at
his
men
felt
intense
satisfaction
because
the
achievement
of
his
mohawks
the
night
before
had
been
brilliant
and
successful
but
he
concealed
it
from
all
save
himself
it
was
not
for
a
chief
who
wished
to
win
not
one
victory
but
a
hundred
to
show
undue
elation
but
he
turned
and
for
a
few
moments
gazed
